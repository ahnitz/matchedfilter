# Iteration plan

A loop for making this package better, and the measurements that say whether
it worked. Run `python tools/health.py` before and after anything here.

This is a working document. When an item lands, replace its entry with the
number it moved and the commit, so the file records what actually changed
rather than what was hoped for.

## The loop

1. **Measure.** `python tools/health.py`, and the four-environment suite below.
2. **Pick one item** from the backlog with the largest measured gap. One.
3. **Write the failing check first.** If the check cannot fail, the item is
   not understood well enough to work on yet.
4. **Change it.**
5. **Re-measure on every environment**, not the convenient one. Most of the
   bugs in the backlog below were invisible on the development machine and
   obvious somewhere else.
6. **Record the number here**, and in the commit message.

### Principles

Added as they are earned, not in advance. Each one exists because its
absence cost something.

1. **Write the failing check first.** If the check cannot fail, the item is
   not understood well enough to work on yet.
2. **Compare the paths to each other, not each to a reference.** Every
   backend was checked against a numerical reference and never against the
   other through the same call, which is why `raw=True` returned three
   arrays on one path and two on the rest, undetected.
3. **Test the case where the right answer is nothing.** A filter's most
   important output is often silence: the dismissal, the empty bin, the
   refusal. `test_run_series_agrees_with_the_cpu` compares the two devices
   on data containing injections, so both sides fire and the comparison is
   made where firing is expected -- which cannot see a gate that fires when
   it should stay quiet. That is exactly the bug in item 0, sitting in a
   well-tested method the whole time. Every agreement test needs a companion
   whose expected result is an empty one.
4. **A probe that reproduces once has not reproduced.** Item 0 appeared,
   vanished under two variations, and returned only when the case was
   swept rather than sampled. Vary one thing at a time and sweep the
   parameter before believing either the presence or the absence of a
   fault.

### The four environments, because three of them found bugs the others could not

| environment | how | what it has caught |
|---|---|---|
| Linux + discrete GPU | `pytest -q` | the baseline |
| macOS + Metal | [physical-device testing](macos-test-machine.md) | threadgroup limits, kernel selection |
| NumPy 1.x | venv with `numpy<2` | `uint64 + int` promoting to float64 |
| low descriptor limit | `bash -c "ulimit -n 256; pytest -q"` | the Vulkan context leak |

A fifth that costs nothing and is worth adding to CI: `ulimit -n 256` on the
existing Linux job.

## Standing measurements

`tools/health.py` prints all of these. Numbers below are from `6b7e6f3` on a
Radeon 8060S; they are the baseline to beat, not targets in themselves.

## Backlog

Ordered by measured size of the gap, not by how interesting the work is.

### 0. GPU hierarchical `run_series` scaling -- DONE (round 2)

The hierarchical `_run_series_gpu` omitted the `1/n` the C applies on the
way in. `_gpu_hier` received `|D|max 304.633` by that route against
`0.0743734` by `run()` on the same blocks: a ratio of exactly 4096. The
gate therefore saw every pair as enormous and escalated all of them.

**The contradiction that held it up for a round resolved into a second
bug.** `test_run_series_agrees_with_the_cpu` compares magnitudes and passed
throughout, which a uniform factor of n should not survive. It passed
because it was **vacuous**: its series was never scaled to unit-variance
output, so the filter saw peaks around 1e-5 against a gate calibrated at
`snr=5.0`, nothing fired on either device, and every assertion compared two
empty selections. It had checked nothing since it was written.

Three things were wrong, each hiding the next:

1. the missing `1/n` (the bug),
2. the unscaled fixture (why no test saw it),
3. `threshold=0.0` in the comparison (why the fixed fixture still failed) --
   below `snr` the GPU legitimately reports a superset, escalating the whole
   interpolation window where the CPU interpolates. At threshold 0 it fires
   52 slots to the CPU's 4, which measures the design. At 5.0 both give 4
   and agree.

A fourth was mine: the first injection used the whitened form
`unit = H/|H|^2`, whose spectrum is `1/conj(H)` and so puts its power where
the template is weakest. The matched filter reports the designed SNR but the
coarse band carries almost none of it, so the gate dismisses for the right
reason. A signal the filter is designed not to find cannot test agreement.
The fixture now injects a scaled copy of the template.

`tests/test_hier_series_scale.py` passes rather than xfails. The fixture is
guarded with `assert fired.any()`.

417 passed on the Radeon box on NumPy 2.4, NumPy 1.26 and at `ulimit -n
256`; 403 on an M2.

### A. Fewer decisions for the user

**Evidence:** 33 environment knobs, 27 with no test pinning their behaviour,
20 undocumented. Plus `binsize`, `window`, `ndata`, `device`, and for the
hierarchical filter `snr`, `fd`, `band`, `oversample`, `taps`.

The tables already remove most of the hierarchical decisions automatically.
The knobs are the opposite: each is a behaviour that can change silently.

1. **Triage the 33.** Each is one of: a real user control (document and test
   it), a developer switch (move behind `MF_DEV_*` and say so in one place),
   or dead (delete). Target: no undocumented knob that is not `MF_DEV_*`.
2. **Make `device="auto"` the documented default** in the README and the
   tutorial, so the first example a reader meets has no device argument.
3. **Default `binsize` to the whole window.** It already does internally;
   the examples should stop passing it.
4. **`ndata` should not be a tuning parameter.** On the flat path it is both
   the batch height and the `run_series` grouping bound. A user should not
   have to know that; `run_series` can group to a sensible internal cap
   regardless of how the plan was built.

**Done when:** the quickstart runs with `MatchedFilter(n, ndata, ntemplates)`
and `.run()`, no other arguments, and `health.py` reports zero undocumented
non-dev knobs.

### B. The host half of `run_series`

**Evidence:** the host-side forward transform is 24-46% of a GPU
`run_series` call and **serial with the device**.

Step 1 landed in round 3, together with D's merge -- the batching had to go
somewhere, and there were two somewheres until the merge. Measured best-of-7
on a Radeon 8060S: host transform 1.38x faster batched (0.79-0.87 ms against
1.09-1.20 ms), stable across three runs.

The earlier figures of 1.41x and then 1.07x for the same change were single
samples. `health.py` now takes best-of-7, which is why the number stopped
moving. **Do not sell this on batching**: 1.38x on a term that is a third of
the call is not the prize. Nothing overlaps host transform, upload and
dispatch, and that is.

1. ~~Replace the per-block Python loop with one strided gather and one
   batched `np.fft.fft(..., axis=1)`.~~ Done, round 3.
2. Chunk the blocks and pipeline: transform chunk *k+1* on the host while
   chunk *k* is on the device. Needs the upload to be per-chunk rather than
   per-call.
3. Only then consider moving the forward transform onto the device.

**Done when:** the host fraction in `health.py` is under 15% and the
whole-call time has dropped by a number recorded here.

### C. Blocking and chunking for the N x T product

**Evidence:** not yet measured; this item's first task is to measure it.

The shape is the point: D segments against T templates is D*T work for
D + T of input. The current code uploads everything and dispatches once.

1. **Measure the roofline for the batch**, as `tools/gpu_roofline.py` does
   for the transform: at what (D, T) does the call stop being compute bound?
   Add it to `health.py`.
2. Pick a tile in (D, T) that keeps the working set in cache on the CPU path
   and in L2 on the GPU path, rather than streaming the bank once per
   segment.
3. The CPU path already has `MF_MFTILE`; it is untested and undocumented.
   Either it is the answer here, or it should go.

**Done when:** there is a measured (D, T) curve in this file and a chosen
tile justified by it.

### D. Duplication

**Evidence:** 6 methods written twice across the GPU backends, 6 more
duplicated between the two filter classes. `_run_series_gpu` is a near copy
in both classes -- written that way knowingly, in 505347d, and now due.

1. **One host orchestration, two thin device layers.** `peaks`, `hier_peaks`,
   `destroy`, `pipeline`, `read`, `write` differ only in which API they call.
   Extract the shared sequencing; leave backend-specific buffer and
   dispatch calls behind a small interface. STILL OPEN.
2. ~~**Collapse `_run_series_gpu`.**~~ Done, round 3. One implementation in
   the base class; `HierarchicalFilter` overrides a three-line
   `_series_window` hook and nothing else. This is the duplication that
   produced round 0's bug -- the two copies drifted and one lost its `1/n` --
   so the merge is the fix for the cause, where round 2 fixed the symptom.
3. The six test-side helpers were already consolidated into
   `conftest.usable_gpu` and `conftest.vulkan_runs` (c3c8dbd). Keep new ones
   out.

**Done when:** `health.py` reports fewer than 3 duplicated methods per pair,
and the count is watched rather than left to drift.

### E. Cruft

1. **`magnitude`.** `ap_peak` still carries the field, the C still fills it,
   four Python buffers still receive it, and every caller discards it. It is
   what let the CPU and GPU return contracts drift apart unnoticed
   (eda2cea). Removing it changes a public struct, so it is its own change.
   `hmf.c` uses `.magnitude` internally for the gate comparisons, which is
   load-bearing -- move it to a local, do not delete the arithmetic.
2. **The slangpy import in `conftest.py`.** Documented as spike-only. The
   shipped backend dlopens Vulkan itself and slangpy is not a dependency.
   Confirm it changes nothing, then delete the workaround and its comment.
3. **Dead knobs**, from the triage in A.

### F. Test gaps

Ordered by what the gap has already cost.

1. **Cross-path contract tests.** Every backend was checked against a
   numerical reference and never against the other backend through the same
   call, so `raw=True` returning three arrays on one path and two on the
   rest was invisible. `test_run_series_flat.py` now does this for arity;
   extend it to shapes, dtypes, and error types.
2. **Resource tests.** The descriptor leak had no check until it had caused
   a full afternoon of misdiagnosis. `health.py` measures it and
   `test_a_dropped_gpu_filter_gives_its_descriptors_back` pins it. Add the
   same shape of test for device memory.
3. **`MatchedFilter.nbins` and `set_coarse_margin`** are each mentioned once
   in the suite.
4. **The 27 unpinned knobs.** Anything surviving triage in A needs a test
   that fails if it stops working.
5. **`test_both_staging_variants_agree` has no Apple host**, by construction:
   the preferred build wants 64 KB of threadgroup memory and no Apple GPU
   has it. Left as a known hole, recorded so it is not rediscovered.

### G. Platform synchronisation

**Evidence:** `LDS_CAP` and `METAL_CAP` are two hand-maintained tables. The
split was correct -- CH=16 is 2.01x on an M2 and a 31% loss on a Radeon
(0c69ba3) -- but it is two tables keyed by hand, and a third device means a
third.

1. **Make the cap a function of device capability, not device name.** The M2
   wants one chunk because it has little threadgroup memory per core; the
   Radeon wants small staging because it has enough to keep several
   workgroups resident. That is a rule, and a rule generalises where a table
   does not.
2. **`tools/gpu_roofline.py` is Metal-only.** Port it to Vulkan so every
   device can be placed against its own measured ceiling. Until then the
   Radeon's achieved rate is known and its achievable rate is not.
3. **Per-device cost tables** now exist for `gfx11` and `apple`. The apple
   key does not distinguish M-series generations; an M4 uses an M2's
   numbers. Decide whether that matters by measuring one.

### H. Cohesion that also buys speed

1. **One Slang source already generates both backends.** Keep it that way;
   every divergence should be a measured trade with the numbers in the
   commit, as the cap split was.
2. **Wave intrinsics.** `WaveShuffle` compiles to `simd_shuffle` on Metal and
   subgroup ops on SPIR-V. Exchange levels whose span stays inside a
   SIMD group can skip threadgroup memory and both barriers entirely. This
   is the one optimisation on the list expected to help *both* backends
   rather than forcing another split.
3. **n=16384 on Apple** runs at 13% of that chip's measured add rate against
   32-52% at every shorter length, on a forced 1024-thread allocation that
   spills. An R=32 decomposition is the candidate.

## Known open items not in the loop

- `v0.1.0a2` is tagged at `eda2cea`, which predates the NumPy 1 fix, the GPU
  gating and the descriptor leak fix.
- The false-dismissal budget: 8/893 omissions, 0.90% against `fd=1e-3`,
  reported from the pycbc side. A violated guarantee outranks everything
  above; confirm it first.
- Band selection at snr 6.0 did not reproduce on a homogeneous template
  bank. The open question is whether the accuracy parameterisation assumes
  bank homogeneity, which would be a larger finding than the original
  report.

## fp16 coarse stage (next)

Measured, committed under `tools/int8/`: fp16 is free for the coarse stage
-- peak error sd 0.0012 sigma, with the gate and the noise escalation equal
to float to three digits (4.300 / 0.0675). It beats bf16 by 9x and needs no
table regeneration, so CPU and GPU can share one accuracy table. int8 is
viable but needs its own recalibration AND a static clip at 6-8 sigma; at
4 sigma it clips the signal peak and costs 3.6x escalation.

Coarse cost is linear in coarse bytes above band 256 on the 8060S
(1.120 / 2.237 / 4.349 ms at band 256 / 512 / 1024). That is the headroom.

The design point that makes this easy: **the coarse stage is a gate, not a
detector.** It does not need per-bin peaks. It needs "does anything in the
window clear the threshold" -- one WaveActiveMax plus a start/end mask --
because the fine stage re-derives localisation on the survivors anyway.

That matters because `groupshared uint stg[CH*WG*2]` in `tierb.slang:57` is
aliased as a per-bin peak table (275-323), and that aliasing was the only
thing blocking half2 packing. Drop the bin machinery from the COARSE kernel
and the constraint disappears: no `nbins <= CAP` proof, no single-bin
variant, and the stage halves from 8 KB to 4 KB. The bin loops must stay in
the flat/fine kernel, where per-bin peaks are the actual output.

Steps:
  1. Confirm the coarse path's output is used only for the gate decision,
     not for reporting bins. This is the one assumption above that is NOT
     yet verified.
  2. Strip the bin machinery from the coarse kernel; keep it in flat/fine.
  3. half2 staging: stg[CAP], f32tof16/f16tof32 in stgPut/stgGet.
  4. Rebuild SPIR-V, run the GPU tests, re-measure the band sweep.

Watch band 128: it costs 1.676 ms, MORE than band 256's 1.120. Cost is not
monotonic in work below 256, which points at an occupancy or launch floor.
LDS is what caps workgroups per CU, so step 3 is the change that should move
it -- and whether it does tells us if fp16's win is bandwidth alone or
bandwidth plus occupancy. Whatever that floor is, it caps the return.

### Roofline: why fp16 alone cannot reach the target

Measured on the 8060S, coarse-only, band 512, 512x512 pairs, 2.196 ms:

    work 6.85 GFLOP   traffic 2.15 GB
    achieved 3.12 TFLOP/s   978 GB/s
    arithmetic intensity 3.19 FLOP/byte

That is ~21% of this part's ~14.8 TFLOP/s fp32 peak, and the kernel is
BANDWIDTH bound, not compute bound. At AI 3.19, sustaining 50 TOPS would
demand 15.7 TB/s. No precision change reaches that: fp16 halves traffic and
buys ~2x, landing near 6 TFLOP/s.

The lever is arithmetic intensity, and it is reuse. The FFT (5*N*log2(N) =
23040 flop/pair) dwarfs the correlation (3072) and is per-pair regardless,
so tiling does not cut work -- it amortises LOADS over K^2 FFTs:

    scheme            loads    FFTs    AI fp32   AI fp16
    now (1 pair/wg)   2 vec      1       3.2       6.4
    8x8 tile         16 vec     64      25.5      51
    16x16 tile       32 vec    256      51       102

**fp16 + an 8x8 tile puts AI near 51 FLOP/byte, which at ~1 TB/s sustains
~50 TFLOP/s.** Neither change gets there alone. That is the target config.

### Measured this round (all reverted; main is green)

  * **LDS half2 staging: NEUTRAL.** A/B at bands 128-4096, differences in
    both directions and within noise. Occupancy is not LDS-limited at these
    sizes -- the coarse stage is 2-4 KB, far under what caps waves/CU. The
    f32tof16 conversions roughly cancel the saving. Do not revisit without
    a reason beyond "LDS is smaller".

  * **Band 128 is NOT a launch or LDS floor.** `WG = NLEN/16`, so band 128
    runs 8-thread workgroups against wave32 -- 25% lane utilisation, and
    3.5x worse per unit work. 256 -> WG 16, 512 -> WG 32. The fix is
    packing multiple FFTs per threadgroup so the wave is full, which is the
    same change the tiling above wants.

  * **fp16 global storage is blocked by a role collision, not by numerics.**
    Ranges are benign (no over/underflow; template dynamic range 22, fp16
    rounding error 1.8e-4). But `fusedTierB` serves TWO roles: the flat
    filter, reading full-precision data/tmpl, AND the untiled coarse stage,
    reading cdata/ct0. Keying the element format on the entry name therefore
    changes both, and the untiled path is the common one -- `_COARSE_TILE`
    tiles only band 256. Packing the buffers made every coarse peak read as
    -1: not precision, just a kernel reading 4-byte elements as 8-byte ones.

    Fix: build a SUFFIXED coarse variant of fusedTierB compiled for the
    packed format, and have the loader pick it for the coarse role only.
    The kernel side is already understood -- one typedef, one `cload`, and
    the single read site at tierb.slang:247.

### Where the coarse stage actually loses 5.7x (measured)

Per-pair cost at band 512, coarse only, varying the pair count:

     4096 pairs  49.19 ns/pair
    16384 pairs  14.84 ns/pair
    65536 pairs   9.57 ns/pair
   262144 pairs   9.52 ns/pair
   affine: 8.89 ns/pair marginal + 0.165 ms fixed

Theoretical compute per pair at fp32 peak is 1.56 ns (23k flop). The
marginal cost is 8.89 ns and STAYS 5.7x off as pairs grow, while the fixed
term is only 0.165 ms. That rules out, by measurement:

  * bandwidth -- halving the coarse element changed nothing (see above)
  * launch overhead -- the fixed term is small, not the 0.75 ms that
    262144 launches at 2.85 ns would imply
  * occupancy from too few workgroups -- 262144 of them is not too few

What is left is the per-pair kernel. `WG = band/16` with ONE pair per
workgroup makes a workgroup exactly one wave32 at band 512. The transform
is then a serial chain of stages, each with an LDS round-trip and a
barrier, run by a lone wave with NO independent work to overlap. It eats
the exchange latency exposed, once per stage.

### Why fp16 matters, and it is not the bytes

half2 halves REGISTER occupancy per point: R=16 complex goes from 32 VGPRs
to 16. That buys either twice the points per thread, or several independent
FFTs resident in registers at once -- and independent transforms are
exactly the ILP needed to cover each other's exchange latency. At small
bands enough of the transform fits in registers that the LDS exchange
disappears rather than being hidden: n=256 as 4x4 in register space, n=512
as 2x2.

So the packed coarse inputs already landed are not a failed bandwidth
optimisation -- they are the input format that lets the transform stay in
half all the way into registers. Measuring them by bandwidth was the
mistake; the gain is register capacity.

Next: half2 through the coarse butterflies (cmul/cmulConj/r4/dft*), then
multiple independent FFTs per thread in the freed register space.

### half2 arithmetic: 4%, and it confirms the diagnosis a third time

The coarse transform now runs in half2 under COARSE16 -- typedef C/CS over
cmul, cmulConj, r4, dft2/4/8/16, innermost, exchange. Native fp16 is really
emitted: the SPIR-V carries capability 9 (Float16), which the fp32 build
does not. Magnitudes and peak output stay float, so the gate comparison and
the reported value are unchanged in type.

    per pair, band 512:  fp32 8.89 ns  ->  half2 8.52 ns   (4%)

Against a 0.78 ns/pair fp16 peak that is still 11x off. Three levers have
now been measured:

    fp16 loads  (half the traffic)  -> nothing
    fp16 math   (half the ALU work) -> 4%
    fewer bytes in LDS              -> nothing

None of them is the constraint, which leaves only the dependency structure:
a lone wave walking a serial chain of FFT stages, each behind a barrier and
an LDS round-trip, with no independent work to overlap. Halving the
arithmetic cannot help a wave that is stalled on an exchange.

So the remaining step is the one that targets it directly, and half2 is
what makes it fit: MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT TRANSFORMS PER THREAD. r[16] in
half2 costs 16 VGPRs where fp32 cost 32, so two or four transforms sit
where one did. Their exchanges interleave and cover each other's latency;
at n=256 four fit in register space (4x4) and the exchange can go away
entirely, at n=512 two (2x2).

This is the change that should move the number. Everything before it was
either a prerequisite (packed inputs, half2 registers) or a falsified
hypothesis (bandwidth, launch, occupancy-from-count, LDS size).

### PPG: fill the wave. 2.3x at band 128, and the rule that bounds it

`WG = band/16` with one pair per workgroup means a band under 512 runs a
workgroup SMALLER than one wave32 -- at band 128, eight threads on a
32-lane wave, three quarters of it idle. PPG packs 512/band pairs into a
group so the lanes are full, each pair getting its own LDS region via
_stgBase, and at band 512 one pair is still exactly one wave so
WaveActiveMax keeps reducing per pair.

    band   baseline   now      (means of 3 runs)
     128    1.911    0.846     2.26x FASTER
     256    1.095    1.107     neutral
     512    2.239    2.390     -7%, inside the noise
    1024    4.348    4.487     -3%, inside the noise

The rule is PPG = 512/band, and it is bounded by exactly what it fixes:
past a full wave there is nothing left to fill. PPG=4 at band 512 changed
nothing and at band 1024 regressed 4.348 -> 5.006, because the per-group
stage grows with PPG while the wave was already full. So the half-width
coarse path is gated to band < 256 -- everywhere else keeps the fp32
kernel, which measured faster.

Two traps this round, both of which produced confident wrong readings:

  * **Run-to-run variance is ~15% at band 128 and ~7% at 512.** Single
    runs supported the opposite conclusion at 256 and 1024. Every number
    above is a mean of three, and the -7%/-3% rows are reported as noise
    rather than as regressions because they are inside that spread.

  * **A PPG=1 build still paid for PPG.** The _sub divide and the
    _stgBase multiply are identity at PPG=1, but the compiler cannot prove
    _sub == 0, and leaving them in cost ~20% at band 512 -- on the DEFAULT
    path, which does not use PPG at all. They are now behind `#if PPG == 1`.
    Computing them into locals matters too: splitting the filterPair CALL
    across #if/#else/#endif failed the preprocessor at n=64.

Still 5.5x off fp16 peak at band 512 (8.5 ns/pair against 0.78). Filling
the wave was worth 2.3x where the wave was empty and nothing where it was
already full, so the remaining gap at full-wave bands is NOT lane
utilisation. It is still the serial exchange chain, and the untried lever
is several independent transforms per THREAD rather than per workgroup.

### Do NOT drop the execution barrier on the single-wave path

The exchange runs two GroupMemoryBarrierWithGroupSync per level and R/CH=1
at band 512, so on a 32-thread group they look like pure overhead: lanes of
one wave are in lockstep, so only the memory fence should be needed.
Replacing them with GroupMemoryBarrier() where WG*PPG <= 32 gives
**61 test failures**.

Vulkan does not guarantee that a 32-thread workgroup occupies a single
wave, and nothing in the memory model makes the LDS writes visible to the
other lanes without the execution sync. The subgroup size is a device
property, not something the group width implies -- a driver may pick wave64
or split the group, and then the exchange reads values that were never
written.

It was not worth it even if it had been sound: band 512 moved 2.390 ->
2.318 ms, inside the ~7% run-to-run spread. If this is ever revisited it
has to go through the subgroup extensions with a real size query, not an
assumption about the group width.

### The coarse stage is bound by LOAD INSTRUCTION COUNT, not bytes or math

Measured by stubbing pieces of the kernel out (results deliberately wrong,
timing only), band 512, 262144 pairs, baseline 2.239 ms:

    exchange deleted entirely     1.981 ms   -> the whole exchange is 12%
    innermost() deleted entirely  2.34  ms   -> the transform is FREE

The butterflies cost nothing and the LDS exchange costs 12%, so ~88% is the
global loads. That is why every precision change so far returned nothing:

    a float2 load is ONE 8-byte dwordx2
    the packed uint32 is ONE 4-byte dword

Same instruction count, half the bytes. If the limit is the RATE OF LOAD
INSTRUCTIONS rather than bytes moved, halving the element is a no-op -- and
that is exactly what was measured, three times.

Per pair: 2*512 complex loads / 32 threads = 32 loads per thread; 268M
loads in ~1.98 ms is ~135 G loads/s against roughly 232 G/s of issue
capacity on this part. The right order to be the limit.

**So the fp16 win is not half the bytes, it is half the LOADS**: pack TWO
complex per 8-byte load (uint2 / four halves) so each load instruction
fetches two points. That halves the load count, which is the quantity that
actually binds. The current packing was one complex per uint32 and
therefore could never have helped.

Also settled: TPT (several transforms per thread) is capped at ~12%,
because all it can hide is the exchange. Not worth the restructuring of
exchange() it would need. Measure before refactoring.

Caveat: the no-load variant timed 23.8 ms and is NOT usable -- a constant
stub makes every lane produce the same magnitude and the InterlockedMax
peak table serialises on contention. Discarded rather than reported.

#### How to halve (quarter) the loads: permute the coarse banks on upload

The blocker is the index pattern. `idx = tid + WG*n2`, so a thread's R
successive loads are WG apart -- coalesced ACROSS the wave for a given n2,
but never adjacent WITHIN a thread, so two of them cannot fold into one
wide load as they stand.

The host builds cdata/ct0, so it can store them in consumption order:
thread tid's R=16 complex values contiguous. Then, packed at 4 bytes per
complex, one thread's whole working set is 16*4 = **64 bytes, exactly one
cache line**, fetched as 4 x uint4 instead of 16 scalar loads.

    loads per thread per buffer:  16  ->  4
    loads per pair:               32  ->  8

Coalescing does not suffer the way it looks like it should: each thread
touches exactly one full 64-byte line and a wave touches 32 distinct lines,
all fully consumed. That is the same bytes with a quarter of the
instructions -- and instructions are what binds.

This is the prestaging the N x M pair grid pays for once: each coarse row
is permuted on upload and reused across every pair that references it.

Order of work:
  1. permute cdata/ct0 in _pack_half2 on the host (pure numpy reshape)
  2. load as uint4 in the coarse kernel, unpack 2 complex per 32 bits
  3. keep the fp32 path untouched -- it is the flat filter's, and it
     measured faster at full-wave bands

### Permuted banks and wide loads: both REJECTED by measurement

Two attempts to cut load instructions, both reverted:

    band                    128     256     512    1024
    baseline (old coarse)  1.911   1.095   2.239   4.348 ms
    permuted, scalar loads 0.836   1.162   2.654   4.558
    permuted, uint4 loads  0.803   1.139   2.628   4.556

Permuting so a thread's R values are contiguous, then loading 4 complex per
uint4 -- 4 load instructions per buffer where the scalar form needs 16 --
made band 512 ~17% SLOWER, not faster.

The reason is that the ORIGINAL layout was already optimal. `idx = tid +
WG*n2` has the 32 lanes of a wave reading consecutive addresses, so one
instruction touches 4 full cache lines, perfectly coalesced. Permuting puts
the lanes 64 bytes apart: 32 distinct lines per instruction, each only
partly used by that instruction. Fewer instructions, far worse coalescing,
and coalescing won.

So the load-issue-rate hypothesis is dead too. The stubbing result stands --
88% of the kernel is the loads, the exchange is 12%, the arithmetic is free
-- but the loads are already issued as efficiently as this layout allows.

What that leaves is not making the loads cheaper but making them FEWER, and
the pair grid is where the redundancy is: every data row is read by all
ntemplates pairs and every template row by all ndata pairs. A workgroup
that handles one data row against K templates loads 1+K rows instead of 2K.
THAT is how global loads approach free, and it is different from PPG, which
packs independent pairs each carrying their own two loads.

### Block-of-4 pre-permutation: also rejected, and what is left standing

Permuting blocked by FOUR (the uint4 width) rather than by R gives loads
that are wide AND coalesced at once -- lane tid reads four consecutive
complex while adjacent lanes read adjacent uint4s, 32 x 16 B = 8 fully used
cache lines per instruction. It is the layout that should have worked.

    band 512:  baseline 2.239   block-of-4 2.622 ms   still ~17% slower

Timing is sound: uploads happen only when the batch is first built, so the
permutation is preparation and sits outside the timed loop. It was checked
rather than assumed.

Stubbing, band 512, baseline 2.239 ms (results wrong, timing only):

    exchange deleted        1.981   12%
    innermost() deleted     2.34    free
    slotToIndex deleted     2.285   free

So the transform, the digit reversal and the exchange together are ~12%,
and no load layout tried -- plain, permuted-by-16, permuted-by-4, scalar,
uint4 -- moves the remainder. Note "88% is the loads" was an inference by
ELIMINATION, never a measurement: the no-load variant timed 23.8 ms because
a constant stub makes every lane produce the same magnitude and the peak
table serialises on atomics. That inference is the weakest link left and
deserves a proper test (vary only the band with work held fixed) before
more layout work.

Eliminated by measurement this session: bandwidth, launch overhead,
occupancy-from-count, LDS footprint, ALU precision, lane utilisation at
full-wave bands, load instruction count, load coalescing, exchange latency
(capped at 12%, which also kills TPT), and digit reversal.

The untouched lever is the one the pair GRID offers: every data row is read
by all ntemplates pairs and every template by all ndata. One data row
against K templates costs 1+K row loads instead of 2K, with the shared row
staged once in LDS. PPG does not do this -- it packs independent pairs that
each still carry their own two loads. That is the next thing to build.

### Template tiling works, and register pressure is the price

The kernel never tiled. `d = pair/ntmpl`, `t = pair%ntmpl`, one pair per
workgroup, each loading BOTH rows -- so every data row was re-read by all
ntmpl pairs referencing it. The batched grid was in the API and unused.

Prototyped: hoist this thread's data slice into `C dreg[16]`, loop TILE_T
consecutive pairs (which share a data row by construction), dispatch
pairs/TILE_T. Loads go from 2*TILE_T*R to R + TILE_T*R -- 144 against 256
at TILE_T=8.

    band                    128     256     512    1024
    baseline               1.911   1.095   2.239   4.348 ms
    refactor, TILE_T=1     0.908   1.113   3.177   9.664
    tiled,    TILE_T=8     0.707   1.125   2.338   7.295

Read the middle row first: at TILE_T=1 the refactor is PURE COST -- same
loads, plus 16 live registers for dreg -- and it costs 42% at band 512 and
2.2x at band 1024, where WG=64 already strains the register file. Tiling
then earns most of that back (3.177 -> 2.338 at band 512), which proves the
load saving is real and substantial.

But it only breaks even against baseline, because dreg in fp32 costs 32
VGPRs. The fix is the one thing not yet combined with it: under COARSE16 a
C is half2, so dreg costs 16 VGPRs instead of 32. fp16 is what makes the
tile affordable -- not bandwidth, not ALU rate, REGISTER FOOTPRINT for the
reused row.

Band 128 already gains outright: 1.911 -> 0.707, 2.70x, up from 2.44x with
PPG alone.

Next: TILE_T with COARSE16 registers at band 512, and a tile that grows
only while occupancy holds -- TILE_T=8 at band 1024 is clearly past it.

### Operation accounting, and the design that reaches 4x

Per THREAD per PAIR at band 512 (WG=32, R=16, NLEVELS=2):

    FFT butterflies            360   VALU  <- useful
    correlation cmulConj        48   VALU  <- useful
    slotToIndex x2 passes      288   VALU
    exchange index math        192   VALU
    want[] construction        160   VALU
    magnitude + window          80   VALU
    global loads                32   VMEM
    LDS write + read            64   LDS
    barriers                     4

    VALU total 1128, of which 408 (36%) is the actual transform.

Sanity: 1128 wave-instructions x 262144 pairs / (40 CU x 2 SIMD x 2.9 GHz)
= 1.27 ms issue-bound against 2.30 ms measured, so ~55% issue efficiency.
Stripping to the useful 408 gives 0.46 ms, which IS the fp32 peak figure,
as it must be. The model is the right order.

**64% of the instructions are addressing, not arithmetic** -- and all of it
is a property of the LAYOUT and the OUTPUT CONTRACT, both of which we
choose. Three deletions, largest first:

  1. **The coarse stage never needs an index, only a maximum.** A max is
     order-independent, and the tiled coarse path already binds only
     [cdata, ct0, cval] -- no cidx. slotToIndex is computed and discarded.
     Its one real consumer is the window test.

  2. **The window is a precomputed MASK.** live = idx in [winStart, winEnd)
     depends on tid and the register slot, never on the pair or template.
     Build a 16-bit mask once per workgroup, then per pair it is a select
     before the max. That removes slotToIndex from the per-pair path
     ENTIRELY rather than leaving it unused -- 288 -> ~0.

  3. **want[] and the exchange index math are the layout talking.** They
     compute where each register's value lives after each level's shuffle.
     Because the banks are pre-arranged and the tile fixes the access
     pattern, the LDS layout can be chosen so each level reads CONTIGUOUSLY
     -- stgGet(base + j*WG + tid) with base a loop constant. The shuffle
     moves into the pre-arrangement, paid once per row on upload and
     amortised over the whole N x M grid.

  4. Whatever survives is loop-invariant across the tile: it depends on tid
     and the level, so TILE_T=8 divides it by eight.

                                          VALU/pair   vs now
    now                                      1128      1.00x
    window mask (kills slotToIndex)           840      1.34x
    + linear-layout exchange                  488      2.31x
    + hoist remainder across TILE_T=8        ~418      2.70x
    + half2 on the useful 408                ~214      5.3x

Two constraints this design MUST respect, both learned the hard way:

  * **Coalescing beats instruction count.** Block-of-16 and block-of-4
    pre-permutations both LOST (17% at band 512) because they put lanes a
    cache line apart. Any pre-arrangement has to keep adjacent lanes on
    adjacent addresses. This is a design input, not something to discover
    afterwards.

  * **The stub measurements are suspect.** Deleting slotToIndex measured NO
    gain despite being 25% of instructions. Either the kernel is stall-bound
    at 55% issue efficiency -- in which case cutting instructions pays
    nothing until the stalls go -- or the stub was dead-code eliminated,
    which this repo's own machine-notes warn about. RESOLVE THIS FIRST;
    the 2.70x above is not bankable until it is explained.

### Per-band accounting: where the remaining 3-3.7x is

Per THREAD per PAIR, VALU:

    band  WG  LV  useful  slotIdx  want[]  exchIdx  mag/win  TOTAL  useful%
     128   8   1     272      192      80       96       80    720     38%
     256  16   1     272      192      80       96       80    720     38%
     512  32   2     496      288     160      192       80   1216     41%
    1024  64   2     496      288     160      192       80   1216     41%

Only ~40% of the instructions are the transform. The overhead is LARGER at
the big bands in absolute terms because NLEVELS goes 1 -> 2 at band 512,
which doubles want[] and the exchange index math and grows NDIG -- while
useful work per thread stays flat, since R is always 16. That is why the
removal multiplier is better there:

    band   now   -slotIdx  -want/exch  +half2   total
     128   720      528         352      216    3.33x
     256   720      528         352      216    3.33x
     512  1216      928         576      328    3.71x
    1024  1216      928         576      328    3.71x

Three steps, each removing work rather than restructuring it:
  1. window as a precomputed MASK -> slotToIndex leaves the per-pair path
  2. pre-arranged layout -> the exchange reads contiguously, want[] goes
  3. half2 on what remains

Constraint carried forward: coalescing beats instruction count. Both
pre-permutations tried so far LOST ~17% at band 512 by putting lanes a
cache line apart. Lane adjacency is an input to the layout, not a
discovery afterwards.

#### slotToIndex collapses from both ends (288 VALU/pair -> ~0)

Three independent reductions, not one:

  1. **The coarse path needs no index.** The tiled coarse kernel binds
     [cdata, ct0, cval] -- no cidx -- and a maximum is order-independent.
     The writeback's slotToIndex computes a value nothing reads. Deletion,
     not optimisation.

  2. **The window mask removes the other consumer**, and the mask is per
     THREAD, not per pair: liveness depends on tid and the register slot
     only. One 16-bit register, built once, then a select before the max.

  3. **Where an index is genuinely needed** (flat / refine), the current
     eager-all-16 shape is wrong twice over:
       * LAZILY -- only the lane that WINS needs its index, and at a real
         threshold that is zero lanes on almost every pair. Cost ~0
         amortised instead of 16 reversals per thread per pair.
       * INCREMENTALLY -- slotToIndex(tid*R + i) for i = 0..15 reverses
         CONSECUTIVE integers, so after the first each next one is a
         reverse-carry increment (~2 instr) rather than a full NDIG-digit
         reversal (~9). 288 -> ~40 even computing all sixteen eagerly.

So on the coarse path the term goes to zero, and elsewhere it drops by ~7x
without changing what is computed.

### One-bin coarse specialisation: the first gain at the LARGE bands

The coarse gate reports one value per pair -- cidx/cval are sized `pairs`,
with no nbins factor -- so nbins is 1 there by construction. Binning is the
FINE stage's job and is untouched. The window is KEPT: winStart/winEnd
still bound the search, which is why this is a specialisation and not a
loss of capability.

Under COARSE16 that deletes, per pair: the per-bin seed loop, the bin
index arithmetic (shift-or-divide per register), the nbins>1 atomic branch,
the bin term in every output index, and the per-bin sweep that writes -1.
The compiled kernel is smaller, 21408 bytes against 21656.

    band       old      now      speedup
     128     1.911    0.756 ms    2.53x
     256     1.095    1.125       neutral
     512     2.239    1.973       1.13x
    1024     4.348    3.827       1.14x

Bands 512 and 1024 improve for the first time. Every earlier attempt --
fp16 loads, fp16 math, half2 LDS, permuted banks, wide loads, PPG -- was
neutral or worse there. What is different is that this one DELETES work
rather than moving it: the earlier changes all kept the same instructions
and tried to make them cheaper.

It also revises the accounting. slotToIndex in the writeback was ALREADY
lazy -- inside `if (myMag[i] > thrBits && ...)` -- so the real per-pair cost
was ~144 VALU, not the 288 recorded. The remaining eager consumer is the
window test in the magnitude loop, which needs the index and is deliberately
kept.

### Full accounting from first principles

IRREDUCIBLE work per thread per pair, derived from the algorithm rather
than from the code (FMA-counted VALU; complex mul = 2 mul + 2 fma = 4; a
16-point DFT = 5*16*log2(16) flop = 160 VALU, once per level):

    band      WG  lv | corr  fft  twid  mag  max | IRREDUCIBLE
    128/256  8/16  1 |   64  160     0   32   21 |    277
    512/1024 32/64 2 |   64  320    64   32   21 |    501

OVERHEAD -- want[] (lv*80), exchange index math (lv*96), slotToIndex for
the window (16*NDIG*3), window compare (32):

    band       total  irreducible  overhead
    128/256      581      277        52%
    512/1024    1029      501        51%

About half of every coarse instruction is addressing, at every size.

ISSUE EFFICIENCY, correcting for waves per pair (band 1024 is two waves at
WG=64, which the earlier table got wrong):

    band  issue-bound  measured  efficiency
     128      0.656     0.756       87%
     256      0.656     1.125       58%
     512      1.163     1.973       59%
    1024      2.326     3.827       61%

Band 128 is nearly issue-bound now, which is exactly why the one-bin
deletion bought 2.53x there and 13% at band 512: at 87% efficiency removing
instructions translates almost one-for-one, at 59% it does not.

PATH:
  1. delete the addressing (51%)            -> 2.05x on instruction count
  2. half2 on the irreducible arithmetic    -> 4.1x in the limit
  3. but 512/1024 run at ~60% issue efficiency, so a realistic landing is
     2-3x; the remainder is stalls, not instruction count, and needs to be
     understood rather than optimised around.

Largest single removable item is now want[] + exchange index math -- 352
VALU at band 512, 34% of the total. That is the pre-arranged-layout work.
slotToIndex is SMALLER than previously recorded because the writeback
consumer was always lazy; only the window test is eager.

### What the GPU is NOT using (per CU: 32 waves, 1536 VGPR/SIMD, 64 KB LDS, 32 KB L1)

    band  WG wav/wg  lanes  LDS/wg  wg/CU LDS/cap  waves/CU  occ  VGPR  L1

**Occupancy is 50% at EVERY band -- 16 waves of 32 -- but the binding
constraint differs**, which is why no single fix generalised:

  * 128/256: the 16-workgroup cap binds; LDS would allow 64 and 32 groups.
    Free: 75%/50% of lanes AND 75%/50% of LDS.
  * 512: LDS and the workgroup cap bind SIMULTANEOUSLY, both at 16.
  * 1024: LDS binds alone, 8 groups x 2 waves.

Idle everywhere: half the waves, half the VGPRs. L1 is 4x oversubscribed at
512/1024 -- 128 KB resident working set against 32 KB.

HOW TO SPEND IT

  * **512/1024**: half2 LDS staging (4 KB -> 2 KB per pair) PLUS PPG=2.
    Two waves per group at 4 KB gives 16 groups x 2 waves = 32 waves/CU,
    full occupancy. NEITHER ALONE DOES IT -- halving LDS leaves 16 groups
    of 1 wave, and PPG=2 alone doubles LDS back and leaves 8 groups of 2.
    That is exactly why both measured neutral in isolation, and it is the
    single most specific prediction on this list.
  * **128/256**: PPG fills idle lanes and free LDS at once. Correct now
    after the per-tile max fix; band 128 already runs at 87% issue
    efficiency.
  * **all bands**: the 50% free VGPRs are what dreg tiling needs, and
    tiling halves L1 demand by sharing the data row across templates,
    relieving the 4x oversubscription.

#### Correction: the L1/VGPR table above assumed fp32 banks

The coarse banks are stored PACKED fp16 (4 B per complex, `_pack_half2`),
so the resident working set is half what that table says:

    band  wg/CU | L1 fp32  L1 fp16  vs 32 KB | VGPR/wave fp32  fp16
     128    16  |   32 KB    16 KB    0.5x   |        96        80
     256    16  |   64 KB    32 KB    1.0x   |        96        80
     512    16  |  128 KB    64 KB    2.0x   |        96        80
    1024     8  |  128 KB    64 KB    2.0x   |        96        80

Packing the banks HAS bought something real, it just never showed in the
timing: L1 oversubscription halves, 4.0x -> 2.0x at the large bands, and at
band 128 the whole resident working set now FITS in L1 -- 16 KB of 32.

That is very likely part of why band 128 reaches 87% issue efficiency while
the others sit near 60%: it is the only band whose working set fits.
Measuring fp16 storage purely as bandwidth, and calling it a null result,
missed the cache effect entirely.

half2 registers also free 16 VGPR/wave (96 -> 80). Occupancy is capped by
LDS and the workgroup limit rather than VGPRs, so that buys no waves
directly -- but it is exactly the room dreg[16] needs for template tiling,
which is the change that ran out of registers in fp32 and regressed band
1024 to 9.7 ms.

### The compiler already amortises pair-invariant work across an unrolled tile

Hoisted want[] and the twiddle tables out of the per-pair path into
per-thread arrays built once in filterPair, reasoning that both depend only
on (tid, level) and that the twiddles are 16 cos + 16 sin per level of
quarter-rate transcendentals -- a term the earlier accounting never counted
at all.

    band 512:  shipped 1.784   hoisted 1.817 ms   (6 runs each)
    band 1024: shipped 3.843   hoisted 3.854

No gain. filterOne is inlined into an [unroll]ed tile loop, so want[] and
the twiddles are identical expressions in all TILE_T bodies and common
subexpression elimination already removes them. Doing it by hand changes
nothing except adding a duplicated code path.

Unconditionally hoisting was actively WORSE at band 1024: 3.84 -> 4.32 ms,
because that band runs TILE_T=1 with nothing to amortise over and sits at
100% occupancy, so the 64 VGPRs of tables come straight out of waves.

**This undermines the static instruction accounting.** The 51% "addressing
overhead" is a count of instructions in the SOURCE; some fraction is
already shared by the optimiser across the tile, so the headroom from
removing it is smaller than the count suggests. Any future estimate built
on that 51% needs to establish how much survives compilation -- by reading
the ISA, not by counting source terms.

That also explains the two tile results: 1xK bought 1.19x and 2D K=2 only
1.07x, both consistent with the loads being the only thing left to
amortise because the addressing was already shared.

### The compiled kernel, measured (RADV_DEBUG=shaderstats)

The source-instruction model mispredicted three changes in a row, so here
is what the hardware actually gets, band 512:

    kernel (by LDS)   SGPR  VGPR  spilled  scratch  code
    coarse, LDS 2048   128   216      0        0    32988 B
    gated,  LDS 4096   128   256     18     2304 B  11480 B
    compact, LDS 0     128    12      0        0      296 B

TWO findings, both of which invalidate earlier reasoning:

1. **The coarse kernel uses 216 VGPRs, not the ~112 modelled.** At 216 the
   part fits floor(1536/216) = 7 waves/SIMD = 14 waves/CU = 44% occupancy,
   not the 50% assumed. REGISTER PRESSURE is the binding constraint, not
   the 16-workgroup cap as recorded earlier.

   This retro-explains every tile result: a K=2 tile adds ~64 VGPR -> 280
   -> 5 waves/SIMD -> 31% occupancy, and K=4 pushes past the file and
   SPILLS. The measured catastrophe at 2D K=4 (10.9 ms) was not a mystery;
   the register model was simply wrong by 2x.

2. **The gated kernel was dead and it was the worst kernel in the build.**
   256 VGPRs, 18 SPILLED, 2304 bytes of scratch -- compiled for every plan
   and never dispatched, because its only caller coarse_odd() was the last
   remnant of the even/odd split and stopped being invoked when the odd
   half was removed. Now not built at all.

Also measured: forcing the tile loop NOT to unroll ([loop] instead of
[unroll]) made band 512 WORSE, 1.78 -> 2.05 ms. The lost ILP costs more
than the registers save, so the pressure cannot simply be scheduled away.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE PLAN

Tiling cannot pay until the base register count comes down. The reducible
term is myMag[16] -- 16 VGPRs held only so the writeback can find which
lane owned the maximum. Recomputing the magnitude in the second pass costs
~2 VALU per register and frees 16 VGPRs, which is the difference between
7 and 8 waves/SIMD. That is the next thing to try, BEFORE any further tile
work, and it should be verified with shaderstats rather than reasoned about.

#### myMag[16] -> liveMask: registers fell, time did not

Replaced the 16 stored magnitudes with a 1-register live mask, recomputing
|v|^2 in the writeback (2 VALU per register; r[] is live there anyway for
peakVal). Registers fell substantially -- the coarse kernel reported 96
VGPRs against 216 -- and band 512 got SLOWER: 1.758 -> 1.878 ms over three
runs each.

So freeing registers is not automatically a win here. The occupancy the
kernel gains does not pay for the recomputation, which says the kernel is
not purely occupancy-starved at 44% -- consistent with [loop] also losing
(1.78 -> 2.05) when it traded ILP for registers.

Two changes now point the same way: at band 512 this kernel is limited by
something that neither more waves nor fewer instructions relieves on its
own. The next honest step is a full ISA disassembly (RADV_DEBUG=asm) to see
the actual instruction mix and stall structure, rather than another
source-level transform -- source-level reasoning has now mispredicted five
consecutive changes.

### The ISA says the fp16 never packed (RADV_DEBUG=asm, band 512)

8456 instructions in the coarse kernel:

    packed fp16   928   v_pk_add_f16 576, v_pk_mul_f16 352      full rate
    scalar fp16   789   v_mov_b16 277, v_sub_f16 184,
                        v_add_f16 184, v_mul_f16 144            HALF RATE
    fp32          598   v_add_f32 216, v_mul_f32 196,
                        v_sub_f32 186
    address/int   933   lshl 282, add_u32 206, and_or 159,
                        add_lshl 145, lshr 141
    stalls/ctrl  1174   s_waitcnt 468, s_delay_alu 451,
                        s_cbranch_execz 255

**Nearly half the fp16 arithmetic is SCALAR, at half throughput.** The
cause is the complex multiply. cmul(a,b) = (a.x*b.x - a.y*b.y,
a.x*b.y + a.y*b.x) is a CROSS pattern: each output half needs a different
combination of input halves, so it cannot lower to elementwise v_pk_*. The
compiler emits scalar v_mul_f16 / v_add_f16 / v_sub_f16 instead.

That is why "fp16 math" measured 4%: half of it never became fp16 math.
The C = half2 typedef made the STORAGE half-width and left the ARITHMETIC
unpacked.

The 598 fp32 ops are the magnitude (float(r[i].x) promotes) and the cos/sin
twiddles, both still single precision.

s_delay_alu at 451 is the compiler inserting explicit dependency stalls --
direct evidence of the ILP starvation that made [loop] lose 1.78 -> 2.05.

FIX: split/SoA complex, which is what the CPU path already does. Hold TWO
complex as (re0,re1) and (im0,im1) in two half2 registers rather than one
complex as (re,im). A complex multiply is then pure elementwise packed:

    re = ar*br - ai*bi      v_pk_mul + v_pk_fma
    im = ar*bi + ai*br      v_pk_mul + v_pk_fma

Four v_pk_* for TWO complex, against a cross pattern that packs none. This
is a layout change to r[], dreg[] and the LDS stage -- not a new algorithm
-- and it is the first change in this effort with direct ISA evidence
behind it rather than a model.

### The SoA rewrite: pair ACROSS transforms, not within one

The ISA says 789 of the half ops are scalar because complex multiply is a
cross pattern. The fix is split/SoA, but the obvious form of it does not
work and the reason matters:

**Wrong: pair adjacent complex within one transform.** half2 holds complex
2j and 2j+1. But a radix-4 butterfly combines elements o, o+4, o+8, o+12 --
which land at the SAME COMPONENT of four different registers. Every
butterfly then needs component extraction, which is the v_mov_b16 traffic
we are trying to remove. Partial SoA pays the movs and gets no packing.

**Right: pair across two INDEPENDENT transforms.**

    re[i] = half2( re of pair A element i , re of pair B element i )
    im[i] = half2( im of pair A element i , im of pair B element i )

Now every operation is elementwise across the two transforms:

    butterfly add   re[a] + re[b]                    v_pk_add_f16
    butterfly sub   re[a] - re[b]                    v_pk_add_f16
    twiddle mul     re*wr - im*wi , re*wi + im*wr    4x v_pk_*  (wr, wi
                                                     broadcast: the twiddle
                                                     is the same for both)
    correlation     same shape as the twiddle multiply

Nothing needs a swizzle or a component extract, because the two lanes of
every register belong to different transforms and never interact.

REGISTER COST IS NEUTRAL: 16 complex x 2 transforms held as re[16]+im[16]
half2 is 32 VGPRs -- exactly what two separate C r[16] cost today. The
rewrite buys packing for free in registers.

And the independent transforms are already there: TILE_T gives 4 pairs per
group, so process them two at a time.

SCOPE: cmul, cmulConj, r4, dft2/4/8/16, innermost, exchange all change
signature from `C r[16]` to `(half2 re[16], half2 im[16])`, plus the load,
the magnitude, the stage and peakVal. It is a rewrite of the complex
representation, ~9 functions, and it must be done in one go -- a partial
conversion is strictly worse than either endpoint, because the boundary
between AoS and SoA regions costs exactly the movs being eliminated.

EXPECTED: 789 scalar half ops -> ~0, and the 598 fp32 ops (magnitude
promotion, cos/sin twiddles) become fp16 or hoist. Against 8456 total
instructions that is the largest single item identified in this effort, and
the first with ISA evidence rather than a model behind it.

## CPU coarse stage: the accounting

Same method as the GPU -- account first, then read what the compiler
emitted rather than reasoning from source.

### Where it sits

    band   coarse-only   ns/pair   flop/pair   achieved    % of peak
     256     0.100 ms     194.8      11776     60.5 GF/s     20%
     512     0.201 ms     392.4      26112     66.5 GF/s     22%
    1024     0.411 ms     803.5      57344     71.4 GF/s     24%

Against ~302 GFLOP/s for one Zen 5 core (151 G lane-op/s FMA x 2 flop,
from docs/machine-notes.md). So the CPU sits at 20-24% of peak -- almost
exactly where the GPU sat, and efficiency rises with band on both.

Theoretical floor at band 512 is 86 ns/pair against 392 measured: **4.5x
of headroom**, the same order the GPU had.

### What the compiler actually emitted

objdump of ap::N_AVX3::fft64_prod, 3063 instructions:

    add/sub      817   vsubps 433, vaddps 384          27%
    vmovaps      424   register-to-register moves      14%
    vmulps       252   UNFUSED multiplies               8%
    FMA          285   all variants                     9%
    vmovups      256   loads/stores                     8%
    scalar addr  696   mov 270, lea 207, add 207        23%

Useful vector arithmetic is 44% -- under half, the same finding as the GPU
(where it was ~40%). Two specifics stand out:

  * **424 vmovaps.** 14% of the kernel is shuffling registers between
    registers. On x86 these are renamed and near-free in latency, but they
    still consume issue slots, and this many is a register-pressure
    symptom against 32 ZMM registers.
  * **252 unfused vmulps against 285 FMAs.** Roughly half the multiply
    work is not reaching an FMA. Some standalone multiplies are inherent
    to complex arithmetic (the first product of a*b - c*d has nothing to
    fuse with), but this ratio is worth checking against what the butterfly
    should emit.
  * **696 scalar addressing ops, 23%** -- proportionally WORSE than the
    GPU's 11%. Same class of overhead, larger share.

### Dead code found and removed

npre, ninterp, nbrk_fire and nbrk_rej: four counters reported under
MF_HMF_DIAG and NEVER INCREMENTED since U and the even/odd split were
removed. The diagnostic printed four zeros plus a "bracket: fired 0
rejected 0" line for a bracket that no longer exists -- which reads as a
measurement rather than as dead text. nskip survives and is the one number
there that means anything.

Still live, but only on the CALIBRATION path (measure_recovery), not the
hot loop: p->cf (a full band-point FFT plan), p->taps and interp_abs.
Worth confirming they are not allocated for plans that never calibrate.

### Order of work (per Alex)

  1. 2D tiling and the other structural items
  2. SWAR last -- the CPU equivalent of fp16 for the coarse stage

### CPU: 2D tiling already exists, and what that means

matchfilt.c:227 already blocks BOTH axes -- `for(dt..nd step tile) for(tt..
nsel step tile)` with `p->tile = 8`, tunable at runtime via MF_MFTILE. So
the tiling I recommended from the GPU work is already there.

But it is CACHE blocking, not work amortisation. Each pair still makes its
own ap_binmax_prod call, so the 696 scalar addressing ops (23% of
fft64_prod) are paid PER PAIR and the tile does nothing about them. The GPU
analogue -- amortising pair-invariant work across a tile -- would require
pushing the tile INTO the codelet so one call handles several pairs, which
is a much deeper change than the loop-level blocking that exists.

**The tile default looks mistuned for the coarse stage.** Its comment
records measurements at 16x16 pairs and n=2^12; the coarse stage has a much
smaller working set (a band-512 row is 4 KB). Swept at 4096 pairs
(nd=32, nt=128), band 512, median of 7:

    tile   1      2      4      8     16     32     64
    ms   1.644  1.553  1.619  1.566  1.486  1.578  1.479

tile 16 and 64 beat the default 8 by ~5%. That is small and shape
dependent -- the existing comment says 8 was never worse on the shapes
tested THEN -- so this is recorded rather than changed. Retuning it
properly needs the cost-table tooling, which is currently broken by the
set_coarse_margin removal. Same stale-tuning class as the GPU cost tables.

### CPU dead code: the interpolation path is unreachable

matchfilt.c:248 guards an ap_interp_max call on `p->ihlo && p->iout &&
p->iser && !p->ipause`, in the INNERMOST pair loop. p->ihlo is set only by
ap_mf_set_interp, and `grep -c interp python/matchedfilter/_core.c` is 0 --
interpolation is not exposed to Python at all. So ihlo is permanently NULL
and the whole block is unreachable, along with ap_interp_max, the candidate
scan, and the iK/incand/ifrac/iser/ipause state that supports it.

This is the same remnant family as the four zero counters already removed:
interpolation was taken out at the Python and hmf.c level and left behind
in matchfilt.c. Worth removing, but it touches the shared flat-filter path
rather than the coarse stage alone, so it needs its own change with the
full suite behind it -- not folded into a coarse-stage optimisation.

### Stalls are not instruction count: two neutral results that say so

After the SoA switchover the largest non-useful block was s_delay_alu 482 +
s_waitcnt 381 = 863, 11.8%. Two attempts to relieve it:

  * **Deeper tile (TILE_T 8).** VGPR 192 -> 216 and band 512 got WORSE,
    1.49 -> 1.82 ms. More tile depth costs registers without adding
    instruction-level parallelism, because SoA gives DATA parallelism --
    two transforms per instruction -- not a second independent chain.
  * **Dual-bank exchange staging.** Staging re and im together so one
    barrier pair carries both. Instructions 7334 -> 7246 and ds_load_b32
    213 -> 85, a real reduction -- and time UNCHANGED, 1.491 -> 1.498 ms.
    Reverted: it doubles LDS, and the resource accounting says LDS is what
    binds at band 1024. Spending a binding resource for no measured gain is
    the wrong trade.

Both say the same thing: at band 512 this kernel is no longer
instruction-bound. Removing instructions stopped paying somewhere between
the bitcast (which paid) and here.

What DID pay, in order: one-bin specialisation, SoA switchover, bitcast
staging, twiddle recurrence. All four DELETE work rather than rearranging
it -- consistent with every earlier result in this effort.

The remaining stalls need a different lever than instruction count: either
independent work in flight (a second SoA group interleaved at the
instruction level, which needs the two groups' exchanges to share barriers
without serialising) or prefetch across the exchange. Neither is a
source-level transform of the kind that has been tried.

### Band 256 takes no tile, and it is the band the teaser runs on

Best-of-7 at band 256, 262144 pairs:

    TILE_T   1       2       4
            1.116   1.109   1.111 ms

Genuinely indifferent at every depth. An earlier comparison of MEANS
suggested a small regression; that was the noise, and best-of-N settles it.

This matters more than the flatness suggests: the teaser workload
(n=4096, 16x1024) autotunes to **band 256**, so it is the band the headline
number actually runs on -- which is why the teaser barely moved while band
512 improved 1.5x and band 1024 1.19x.

The headroom is there. Per unit work band 256 is ~1.67x LESS efficient than
band 512: 4.23 ns/pair for 2048 band*log(band) against 5.68 ns for 4608.
Tiling simply is not the lever. Its profile differs structurally -- WG =
256/16 = 16 threads with PPG 2 filling the wave, and NLEVELS = 1, so it has
ONE exchange where band 512 has two. It needs its own disassembly rather
than an assumption carried over from 512, and that is the next piece of
work with a clear payoff attached.

## CPU coarse stage: results and the negatives

Cumulative, interleaved old/new so machine drift cancels (this box moves
~18% between runs minutes apart, so sequential A/B is not usable here):

    coarse band  512   1.455 -> 1.205 ms   1.218x   6 of 7 pairs
    coarse band 1024   2.728 -> 2.568 ms   1.063x   7 of 7
    coarse band 2048   5.941 -> 5.247 ms   1.132x   7 of 7
    flat  n=4096       0.699 -> 0.639 ms   1.094x   6 of 6

Band 512 is the band the CPU autotuner selects, and the flat filter gains
too, so this is not confined to the hierarchical path.

### What produced it

Both wins were the same SHAPE: a knob that existed and had never been set
for these sizes.

  * **N1xN2 split.** create() hand-tuned 2^12 and 2^18 -- the FLAT filter's
    sizes -- and left 2^8..2^11 on the balanced default. 16x32 at 2^9 and
    128x16 at 2^11.
  * **p->ilay.** The contiguous intermediate layout was implemented in both
    stage A and stage B, the buffer was sized for it, and nothing ever
    assigned the field. create() memsets the plan, so the strided path was
    the only one that had ever run.

Plus MF_HMF_TRACE being read via getenv inside the per-pair loop.

### Negatives -- measured, do not retry

  * **GMAJOR=0** (the non-group-major stageA_prod): 0.665 and 0.744 of the
    default at bands 512 and 2048. The default path is right.
  * **GBLK=4/8, BBLK=2**: within noise at coarse sizes. The existing rules,
    though derived at 2^16+, happen to pick correctly here.
  * **MF_NOSTORE**: no effect. The coarse plan has no series buffer.
  * **Hoisting plan fields out of stageA_tail** to defeat aliasing: the
    generated code was BYTE-IDENTICAL, 1245 instructions either way.
    Strict aliasing already lets GCC prove a float store cannot touch an
    int struct member, so it had hoisted them itself.
  * **Dropping the unused arr/aii/axx accumulators from binmax_one**: they
    sit inside `__builtin_expect(..., 0)` and almost never execute at a
    real threshold. Worth ~0.

### Method notes

  * **Static disassembly of a function with runtime branches is
    misleading.** stageA_prod_gm reads 1245 instructions before and after
    the ilay change because both store paths are compiled in; only one runs.
  * **I analysed dead code first.** The initial CPU instruction mix came
    from fft64_prod, which had ZERO call sites at the time. Sampling with
    gdb gave the real set: stageA_prod_gm, codelet_prod, fftsr16,
    binmax_core. (The small-N path has since given fft64_prod a caller --
    band 64 is a single 64-point codelet -- which does not change the
    lesson: check before you analyse.)
  * The coarse stage is now ~2.2x off single-core FMA peak, down from ~2.6x.
    What remains is spread across the transform machinery rather than
    concentrated anywhere: two 16x16 transposes per block in stageA_tail,
    and the codelets themselves.

## The CPU/GPU band gap: CLOSED

             CPU before   GPU            CPU now
      64     absent       n=1024         every n
     128     absent       n=1024..4096   every n
     256     all sizes    up to 4096     all sizes
     512     all sizes    up to 8192     all sizes
    1024     2048+        2048+          2048+

Every cross-device test used to skip band 128, and skipping it is how the
GPU wave-reduction bug survived: the only comparison that could see it
needed a CPU plan that did not exist. The (n, band) sweep now runs 24 of 24
cells on the CPU against 14 before, and the CPU's coverage is asserted
EXACTLY in test_every_size_and_band_is_correct_not_merely_runnable, so a
band cannot go missing again without the sweep failing.

### Root cause

The balanced two-stage split puts AP_W lanes across n1 in stage A and across
n2 in stage B, so both factors need a full vector: N >= AP_W^2, which is 256
on AVX-512. On AVX2 and SSE4 it was policy rather than structure -- they
could have split 64 as 8x8 -- but supported() hard-coded `N<256u` to keep
the accepted set identical across back ends, so a plan could not succeed on
one machine and fail on another.

### What closed it

A single-stage path for the small sizes with **lanes across independent
pairs** instead of across n1. The coarse stage always has pairs to spare, so
the lanes are free, and with lanes = pairs there are no stages at all: the
whole N-point transform is one element transform, which efft/efft_prod
already do. No four-step, no corner turn, no intermediate.

  * `create_small()` in balanced-inl.h builds a plan carrying only the
    element buffers, the element twiddles and the bin accumulators.
  * `binmax_prod_batch` runs AP_W pairs in one call; `small_scan` keeps one
    running maximum per lane, and since every lane shares the output index
    the scan is a plain walk over the window.
  * The matched filter stores its template bank `[group][element][lane]`
    when the plan asks for it, so the transposition is paid once per
    template at ingest rather than per pair. The data spectrum is the same
    in every lane, so it is broadcast once per segment.
  * The cutoff is a constant 128, not AP_W^2, so the narrow targets do not
    take a different path from the wide ones at 64.

### The bug it uncovered

`fft8_prod` wrote its result into the SCRATCH buffer pair and reported that
in its return value. Every caller of codelet_prod ignores the return value,
so an 8-point product codelet was silently wrong -- and nothing had ever
asked for one, because efft_prod only fuses single-level element transforms
and 8 never came up as one. Band 128 factors 16x8, asked for it, and came
back as noise.

The fix is in gen.py, where the other single-pass codelets already avoid it:
a codelet that does not READ ar can write its result there and keep the
ping-pong parity even. One condition was missing `prod`. Regenerating
changes 9 lines, all in fft8_prod. codelet_prod now documents the contract.

### The opportunity it exposed

The pair-batched path is not just a fallback for sizes the balanced split
cannot reach -- it is FASTER at the sizes it can. Interleaved in one build
(MF_PBMAX moves the cutoff), nd=8 nt=64:

    N= 256   213.1 -> 86.5 us   2.16x
    N= 512   583.8 -> 313.4 us  1.97x
    N=1024   626.6 -> 381.4 us  1.61x     8 of 8 rounds at every size

That is a larger win at the coarse sizes than everything else measured on
the CPU this session. What stops it being the default is the small end:
lanes are pairs, so a batch below AP_W pads, and the padding is real work --
0.52x at N=256 nd=1 nt=1, 0.19x at N=1024. The crossover is around
nd*nt ~ 24.

Raising the cutoff therefore needs a policy on batch shape, and probably
lanes that flatten (d, t) rather than spanning templates within one d, so a
one-template batch can still fill them from the data side. Left as the next
item rather than folded in here: this change is the bands, and a cutoff
argued from a benchmark that only ever ran wide batches would be a fitted
bound.
