# Historical CPU optimization results

These measurements describe an earlier implementation. For the current API
and calibration contract, see [usage](usage.md) and [the gate model](gate-model.md).
The recorded timings explain the layout and dispatch decisions; they are not
current performance claims.

## Coarse transform and layout changes

Cumulative, interleaved old/new so drift cancels:

    coarse band  512   1.455 -> 1.205 ms   1.218x   6 of 7 pairs
    coarse band 1024   2.728 -> 2.568 ms   1.063x   7 of 7
    coarse band 2048   5.941 -> 5.247 ms   1.132x   7 of 7
    flat  n=4096       0.699 -> 0.639 ms   1.094x   6 of 6

  * **N1xN2 split tuned for the coarse sizes.** create() had only ever
    tuned 2^12 and 2^18 (the FLAT filter's sizes); 2^8..2^11 took the
    balanced default. Now 16x32 at 2^9 and 128x16 at 2^11.
  * **p->ilay enabled.** The contiguous intermediate layout was implemented
    in both stages with a correctly-sized buffer and nothing ever assigned
    the field, so the strided path was the only one that had ever run.
  * **MF_HMF_TRACE hoisted** out of the per-pair loop (getenv was 1 of 26
    samples).

Verified across ISAs: 424 passed under MF_ISA=AVX3, AVX2, SSE4. The 2^11
split helps every ISA; 2^9 is an AVX-512 effect that costs others nothing.

## CPU bands 64 and 128: DONE

Implemented as designed below, plus two things the design did not foresee.

    coverage of the (n, band) sweep   CPU 14 -> 24 of 24 cells
    pytest                            427 passed, 3 skipped
    ISAs                              294 passed under AVX3, AVX2 and SSE4

### What landed

  * `pairbatch_size()` / `create_small()` in balanced-inl.h: a plan for
    N <= 128 carrying only the element buffers, the element twiddles and the
    bin accumulators. No four-step, no corner turn, no intermediate -- with
    lanes across PAIRS the whole N-point transform is one element transform.
  * `binmax_prod_batch` runs AP_W pairs per call; `small_scan` keeps one
    running maximum per lane. Every lane shares the output index k, so the
    scan is a plain walk over the window.
  * `pairbatch`/`binmax_prod_batch` on the back-end struct, `split()` and
    `has_prod()` returning 0 for these plans so the matched filter does not
    store spectra group-major for a split that does not exist.
  * matchfilt.c stores the template bank `[group][element][lane]` when the
    plan asks, pads it to a multiple of AP_W with zeros, and broadcasts the
    data spectrum into `[element][lane]` once per segment. A scattered
    `tsel` gathers into a staging pair instead.
  * `fft()`, `binmax()` and `binmax_split()` on a small plan reuse the pair
    kernel with the input broadcast to every lane. They are setup-path calls
    at these sizes; a second kernel would be a second correctness surface.

### The bug underneath it

`fft8_prod` wrote its result into the SCRATCH buffer pair and said so in its
return value. Every caller of `codelet_prod` ignores that return value, so
an 8-point product codelet was silently wrong -- and nothing had asked for
one, because `efft_prod` only fuses single-level element transforms and 8
never arose as one. Band 128 factors 16x8, asked for it, and came back as
noise at 1e34.

Fixed in gen.py, where the other single-pass codelets already avoid it: a
codelet that does not READ `ar` can write its result there and keep the
ping-pong parity even, and the `prod` case was missing from that condition.
Regenerating changes 9 lines, all inside fft8_prod; everything else is
byte-identical. `codelet_prod` now states the contract.

### Pair batching at 256–1024: adaptive dispatch

Automatic dispatch now opts in on measured AVX3, AVX2 and SSE4 targets for
actual calls with at least 8 data segments and 16 contiguous templates,
aligned template start, at least 75% SIMD lane occupancy, and a single bin
covering at least half the transform. Other calls retain the balanced path.
The total D×T is insufficient: lanes span templates, and 32×1 pads badly.
One-data calls also regressed when ingestion was included, despite wins in
kernel-only timing, so they deliberately retain the balanced path.

A second packed layout is allocated lazily on the first eligible call.
Only initialized requested rows are copied; later setters update both layouts.
This adds memory and first-call setup cost, and alternating wide and narrow
calls retains the second layout. Allocation failure falls back to balanced.
`MF_PBMAX=128` forces balanced at these sizes, and `MF_PBMAX=1024` forces
pair batching; neither environment override is changed internally.

Interleaved measurement on Ryzen AI Max+ 395, AVX3, 8×64, seven rounds:

| N | Steady-state speedup | Including data and template ingestion |
|---|---:|---:|
| 256 | 2.31× | 1.81× |
| 512 | 1.90× | 1.48× |
| 1024 | 1.83× | 1.37× |

Every round won at these shapes. These are matched-filter batch timings,
not a claim of equivalent end-to-end PyCBC speedup. Reproduce with
`python tools/bench_pairbatch.py` and `--include-ingest`; use `MF_ISA=AVX2`
or `MF_ISA=SSE4` for narrower targets. ARM retains its original dispatch
until measured there. Regression tests exercise updates, subsets, padding,
windows, counts, and hierarchical series against forced balanced execution.

### The design, as it was written and as it held

Process AP_W PAIRS per call with lanes across pairs, so there are no stages
and no corner turn.

  1. `efft_prod` already does product + transform for AP_W independent
     lanes, and for M2==1 calls `codelet_prod(M, ..., 1, AP_W)` -- S=1,
     DS=AP_W -- which already expects `[freq][pair]`. Held exactly, for
     band 64. Band 128 takes the M2!=1 branch, which had never run, which
     is where fft8_prod was waiting.
  2. **Transpose at INGEST, not in the loop.** Held: the template bank is
     transposed in `ap_mf_set_template`, and the data side needs no
     transpose at all because it is the same in every lane.
  3. **One function replaces the pipeline.** Held: stageA_prod_gm, stageB
     and binmax_one collapse into efft_prod + small_scan.
  4. Plan plumbing. Held, plus two back-end entry points the design did not
     account for.

### Rejected fallback -- still rejected, now with a number

Accepting band < 256 and internally using 256. It would have given no
speedup and a different coarse statistic from the GPU's. Measured, band 128
costs 0.067 us/pair against band 256's 0.351: a factor of 5.2 that the
fallback would have thrown away.

## SUPERSEDED IN PART: the gate model landed

The other session replaced the measured threshold table with an analytic
gate model (`python/matchedfilter/gatemodel.py`); `accuracy.txt` and
`threshold.txt` are gone and `cost.txt` is regenerated. Most of the
threshold-table diagnosis below is therefore history rather than a
description of the code. What survives is worth recording, because the two
lines of work were independent and they agree.

**The model reproduces thresholds this investigation measured by bisection
against injections**, at n=4096, snr 5.0, fd 1e-3:

    band   bisected safe   re-measured now   gate model   model vs safe
     256      3.4125            3.4146           3.3541      1.8% low
     512      3.8825            3.8782           3.9224      1.1% high
    1024      4.3502            4.3374           4.3604      0.5% high

The middle column matters. Those bisections were run BEFORE the gate was
replaced, and one of the commits doing it says the fix "was the noise
convention" -- so the obvious objection is that the two columns are not on
the same scale and the agreement is an accident. Re-running the bisection
against the current code answers it: 3.4146, 3.8782, 4.3374 against the
earlier 3.4125, 3.8825, 4.3502, reproducing to 0.3% across the refactor.
Same scale, so the comparison holds.

An analytic model and a measured bisection, built separately and agreeing
to 2%, is a much stronger statement than either alone. The model sits 1.1%
and 0.5% ABOVE the measured-safe value at bands 512 and 1024 -- the unsafe
direction -- but that is inside the 1.0-1.3% repeatability of the bisection
itself, so it is at the boundary rather than over it. Against the old
table's +3.5% to +15%, that is the whole improvement.

**The band-key defect is fixed.** At a fixed (f = 0.70, ratio = 1.20) the
old table returned one value for every band; the model varies. The test
that pinned the defect -- `test_the_threshold_table_is_still_band_blind` --
was updated into `test_model_distinguishes_bands_with_identical_old_table_keys`,
which is what its own failure message asked for.

**Band 128 remains not worth selecting, and now for a visible reason.**
Under the model it takes a threshold of 2.5550, dismisses 0 of 523
injections, and runs at 0.98x of the flat filter. That is this document's
earlier conclusion arrived at from the other direction: the band cannot be
both correct and fast, and the 2.43x it used to show was budget being
spent.

    band   threshold   dismissed   vs flat
     128     2.5550      0/523      0.98x
     256     3.3541      0/523      1.65x
     512     3.9224      1/523      4.53x
    1024     4.3604      0/523      5.13x

**Selection still picks a slower band, but the gap has closed a long way.**
It chooses 512 at 4.53x where 1024 measures 5.13x -- 1.13x left on the
table, against 1.84x before. The cost-table finding stands in kind and is
much smaller in degree.

### What survives of this investigation, and what does not

    still live    the cost table is a grid and is still interpolated, so
                  it can still misrank -- 1.13x, down from 1.84x.
                  `audit_threshold.py --coverage` reports its grid against
                  the range real references query.
                  `--repeat N` gives the bisection's noise floor, 1.0-1.3%.
                  tests/test_heterogeneous_bank.py -- the reference
                  normalisation in hmf.c refresh_template() is unchanged.
                  tools/cost-retuned-4096-experimental.txt, worth 1.51x
                  over the points where the pick changes.

    superseded    everything about the measured THRESHOLD table: its band
                  key, its low-ratio corner, its trial counts. The table is
                  gone and gatemodel.py replaces it.
                  tools/regen/threshold_lowratio.py, removed with it.
                  tools/threshold-by-band-4096-experimental.txt, kept only
                  as the measurement that showed band belongs in the key.

    confirmed     band 128 is not worth selecting. Reached here by measuring
                  that a safe gate admits 92% of pairs; reached again under
                  the model, which gives it 0 of 523 dismissed at 0.98x of
                  flat.

## The overnight investigation, 2026-09-26

Eleven cycles of measure-commit-review so far, of twenty. One change
shipped; the rest is diagnosis, and three of the commits retract earlier
ones of mine.

### Shipped

**Split-radix product codelets** (72ec6c4). The Stockham `fft*_prod`
codelets bounce through a scratch buffer between their two passes, indexed
at the OUTPUT stride so successive calls walk the whole element buffer. The
split-radix codelets do the whole DAG in registers -- they carry
`(void)br;(void)bi;` -- and gen.py had no product variant. Adding one
deletes the traffic rather than blocking it better. Paired and interleaved:

    AVX-512  band 256 1.044-1.164   band 512 1.137   band 1024 1.073
    AVX2     band 256 1.103          band 512 1.100   band 1024 unchanged
    SSE4     band 256 1.053          band 512 1.072   band 1024 unchanged
    flat n=4096 1.054 (5 of 5); n=16384 and 65536 unchanged, and those are
    controls -- eprod_ok is false there so codelet_prod is never called.

Band 1024 is "unchanged" on the narrow targets by design, not by omission:
m=32 is where it lands and m=32 is gated to AP_W >= 16.

m=32 and m=64 gated to AP_W >= 16: ungated, m=32 measured 1.075x on
AVX-512 but 0.991x on AVX2 with the new side swinging 292-332us against a
steady 305-308. n=128 is a built-in control (it uses neither changed
codelet) and measures 1.00.

### The threshold table is keyed on the wrong thing

Chasing why bands 64/128 cannot be selected ended somewhere unexpected. The
blocker was recorded as a performance regression; it is a correctness one --
band 128 dismisses 2.9e-2 of INJECTED SIGNALS against a 1e-3 budget.

The cause is the table's key, `(n, f, ratio, snr, fd)`, which omits band on
the argument that samples-across-the-peak is `band/B_eff` with no band left
in it. At a fixed (f=0.70, ratio=1.20) the safe threshold runs 2.8078,
2.9797, 3.1000, 3.2719 across bands 128/256/512/1024 -- **16.5% on the band
axis alone**. It is the coarse maximum: a max over `band` lags grows like
sqrt(2 ln band), and sqrt(ln band) predicts the other three points within
2.7%.

The full grid (`tools/threshold-by-band-4096-experimental.txt`, 59 rows)
shows the spread is ordered by f -- 19.9% at f=0.60 down to 3.1% at
f=0.995 -- because as f approaches 1 the signal dominates the noise floor.
**That is why both shipped tables could omit band and look correct.**
threshold.txt is measured at one band per n. accuracy.txt justifies the
same omission with a 1.14x spread measured, its own header's words, "across
band/B_eff from 16 to 128" -- every cell at ratio >= 16, where band does
not matter. Real references run at ratio 1.3-5.3. Both validated the
omission outside the operating range, so the third key is two tables.

Applying a sqrt(ln band) correction at lookup INSTEAD was measured and
rejected: 2.13x slower at band 256, 1.88x at 512, to fix a 4% margin that
dismisses 0 of 523 injections. A gate is nonlinear in its threshold and
few-percent accuracy is not enough to apply to one.

### Why bands 64 and 128 cannot be selected -- the real reason

Not a missing table entry. Applying the sqrt(ln band) correction to band 128
alone DOES fix its correctness: dismissal goes from 15 of 523 to 0 of 523.
It also takes escalation from 37.5% to 92.2%, and that is the whole story.
Timed against the flat filter on the same data, n=4096:

    band   threshold                time      vs flat
     128   table  3.3341           1039 us     2.43x
     128   BISECTED SAFE 2.8956    2403 us     1.05x
     256   table  3.5307           1048 us     2.41x
     256   BISECTED SAFE 3.4125    1352 us     1.87x
     512   table  4.0354            411 us     6.15x
     512   BISECTED SAFE 3.8825     619 us     4.08x

(Against the BISECTED-safe threshold, not the sqrt(ln band) correction. The
correction is over-conservative -- at band 256 it gives 3.158 where safe is
3.4125 -- and a first pass at this used it as a proxy for "safe", which
overstated the cost of safety at band 256 as 1.15x rather than 1.87x. The
audit measures safe directly; use that.)

**The small-band speedup is bought with a threshold that is too high.** At
band 128 the reference lands at ratio 1.24, the coarse grid is too coarse to
localise the peak, and a gate safe enough to keep signals admits 92% of
pairs -- so the hierarchical filter degenerates to the flat filter plus a
coarse pass. The 2.51x is a false-dismissal budget being spent, not work
being saved.

That also retro-explains the observation this whole thread started from:
installing the small-band cost rows made selection pick band 128 at 4.37x
where band 512 measured 10.75x. Selection picked it because the cost table
said it was cheap -- and those costs were measured at the unsafe threshold.
With a safe one it is not cheap.

Bands 256 and 512 both survive, at 1.87x and 4.08x. Their table rows sit
3.5% and 3.9% above the bisected-safe value (12000 trials a bisection step,
so about three times the 1.0-1.3% noise floor), and that headroom is worth
2.41/1.87 = 1.29x at band 256 and 6.15/4.08 = 1.51x at band 512. Real, but
not where most of the speedup comes from -- which is what separates them
from band 128, where the safe configuration keeps nothing at all.

### SELECTION PICKS THE SLOWER BAND, and it is worth up to 1.8x

The most actionable finding of the night, and it needs no new kernel.
Timed on the default inspiral reference at n=4096, every admissible band,
against what selection chose:

    snr   fd      picked    256     512    1024
    5.0  1e-2     512       514    [293]    499
    5.0  1e-3     512      1038    [416]    661
    5.5  1e-2     512       337    [208]    414
    5.5  1e-3     512       587    [253]    510
    6.0  1e-2     256       264    [204]    407    512 is 1.30x faster
    6.0  1e-3     256       384    [209]    415    512 is 1.84x faster
    6.5  1e-2     256       [93]    206     413
    6.5  1e-3     256       339    [206]    419    512 is 1.64x faster

Three of eight points pick the slower band. `tools/score_selection.py`
agrees independently at its own operating point: picked (256, 8) for 6.18x
where (512, 8) gives 11.88x -- **52% of best**.

The cause is the cost table, not the rule. At snr 6.0 fd 1e-3, normalised
to band 1024:

    band   table cost   measured   table is
     256     0.4963      0.925     1.9x too CHEAP
     512     0.5649      0.504     about right
    1024     1.0000      1.000     --

Ranked by table cost the order is 256, 512, 1024; ranked by the clock it is
512, 256, 1024. Band 256 is priced at half what it runs, so selection takes
it. Note that `audit_threshold.py --coverage` says cost.txt DOES cover the
operating range in (f, B_eff), so this is not the extrapolation failure the
small-band cost rows have -- the rows exist and are wrong, or the IDW
interpolation lands on rows from a different escalation regime.

**It is not one query.** Sampled over five reference shapes and two SNRs,
comparing table cost against the clock, both normalised to band 1024:

    reference     snr    TABLE 256/512/1024      CLOCK 256/512/1024
    inspiral      5.5    0.716 0.647 1.000       1.251 0.545 1.000
    inspiral      6.0    0.496 0.565 1.000       0.940 0.509 1.000   MISRANKED 1.84x
    shallow       5.5    1.854 0.956 1.000       1.832 1.689 1.000   MISRANKED 1.69x
    shallow       6.0    1.750 0.778 1.000       1.899 1.402 1.000   MISRANKED 1.40x
    steep         5.5    0.371 0.541 1.000       0.708 0.507 1.000   MISRANKED 1.40x
    steep         6.0    0.317 0.521 1.000       0.339 0.539 1.000
    late knee     5.5    1.159 ----- 1.000       1.610 ----- 1.000
    late knee     6.0    1.057 ----- 1.000       1.888 ----- 1.000
    early knee    5.5    0.300 0.519 1.000       0.226 0.494 1.000
    early knee    6.0    0.289 0.518 1.000       0.230 0.492 1.000

**4 of 10 misranked, costing 1.40x to 1.84x**, across three different
reference shapes. The errors are not one-directional -- band 256 is
underpriced on inspiral and steep, overpriced on early knee, and band 512
is underpriced on shallow -- so this is not a constant to correct out.

Re-run over three independent noise realisations, the RANKING is stable at
every point -- the same band wins each draw -- while the magnitudes move a
lot: band 256 on the inspiral reference at snr 5.5 measures 1.22, 0.95 and
1.79 relative to band 1024 across seeds. So the claim to make is that the
table picks the wrong band, not that it is wrong by a particular factor.
The 1.40-1.84x figures are one draw's worth.

`hmf_tune.py --retune-cost` re-measures the table for a machine. It could
not run at all until this session -- it died on the first configuration the
library declines (band 64 has no calibrated threshold) after 160 rows, which
is a fair explanation for how the table drifted this far unnoticed.

**Re-measuring helps and does not fix it.** Against a partial retune (48
keys at n=4096; the run was still going), ranking the same six points:

    reference   snr    old     new    clock
    inspiral    5.5    512     512     512     already right

    steep       6.0    256     512     256     REGRESSED

Right at 2 of 6 before, 4 of 6 after.

**The lookup is not the fix, and that was worth checking before anyone
tuned it.** One point regressing suggested the pricing rule shared the
blame. It does not. Every rule score_cost_rule.py implements, applied to
the SHIPPED rows at these six points:

    covering (f>=ours, max)    2 / 6   worst 1.83x
    pessimistic (f<=ours,max)  2 / 6   worst 3.74x
    nearest in (f, beff)       3 / 6   worst 2.14x
    interp in f                3 / 6   worst 2.14x
    plane fit (f, beff) k=6    3 / 6   worst 2.14x
    plane fit (f, beff) k=4    3 / 6   worst 3.00x
    IDW (f, beff) k=4          3 / 6   worst 2.14x   <- what ships

No rule gets past 3 of 6, and none of them raised -- 252 rule evaluations,
0 exceptions, no band silently dropped from a ranking, which is the way a
comparison like this flatters one rule by accident. The shipped rows cannot
support a correct ranking under any of them, while re-measured rows reach
4 of 6 under the rule that already ships. So the rows are the problem; changing how they are
interpolated is not a route, and the single regression is more likely
variance than evidence about the lookup.

The obvious explanation is coverage, and it is wrong. The retuned rows
span f 0.690-1.000 against the shipped table's 0.122-1.000 -- dense but
narrow, 770 distinct (f, B_eff) anchors at n=4096 against 51 -- so the
natural guess is that the failing points extrapolate. They do not:

    reference   band 256   band 512   band 1024
    inspiral     0.8832     0.9584     0.9882
    shallow      0.6950     0.8455     0.9403
    steep        0.9638     0.9914     0.9983

All inside 0.690-1.000, and the regressed point (steep, snr 6.0) is at
f >= 0.96, nowhere near an edge. Only shallow at band 256 is marginal, at
0.6950 against a 0.690 floor, which may bear on the one shallow point that
stayed wrong.

So the remaining misrankings are not a coverage artefact, and what is left
to suspect is the lookup itself or variance in the retune. Not resolved.

NOT provisional at n=4096. The retune covered that size completely -- 48
keys, 9560 rows, identical between two snapshots of the run -- so the 4 of
6 stands. The rows are kept at
`tools/cost-retuned-4096-experimental.txt`, with what they change:

    reference   snr   old pick -> new    t(old)   t(new)   effect
    inspiral    6.0     256  ->  512      408us    207us   1.97x FASTER
    shallow     5.5     512  -> 1024      981us    587us   1.67x FASTER
    steep       5.5     256  ->  512      294us    208us   1.41x FASTER
    steep       6.0     256  ->  512      136us    205us   1.50x slower

    total over the four changed points: 1819us -> 1207us = 1.51x net

So installing them is worth about 1.51x where the pick changes. They are
NOT installed, for three reasons rather than general caution:

  1. The retune SKIPPED n=8192 -- straight from 4096 to 16384 -- although
     8192 has ACC2 rows and the shipped table carries 3600 for it. Until
     that is explained the run cannot be trusted to have covered what it
     was asked to, and that is a bug in the tool, not in the rows.
  2. Its size set does not match the shipped table's, which also has
     65536, 131072 and 262144. Any install is per size, not a file swap.
  3. One point regresses 1.50x, which is a trade for a person.

Completeness of what it DID produce is not in doubt: the retune writes
sizes in order and never revisits one, and the n=1024, 2048, 4096 and 16384
blocks are contiguous, so those four are complete and only 32768 is
partial.

**The faster band is admissible**, which is the check that makes this a
defect rather than selection being right for a reason I had not measured.
Injections at 1.04*snr, 510 per cell:

    snr 6.0 fd 1e-2   band 256  0/510        band 512  5/510 = 9.8e-3
    snr 6.0 fd 1e-3   band 256  0/510        band 512  1/510 = 2.0e-3
    snr 6.5 fd 1e-3   band 256  0/509        band 512  1/509 = 2.0e-3

All within budget. One qualification: at snr 6.0 fd 1e-2 band 512 sits AT
its budget (9.8e-3 against 1e-2) while band 256 has the whole of it spare,
so picking 256 there buys margin for a 1.30x speed cost. That would be a
defensible trade -- but it is not the trade selection made, since selection
priced 256 as cheaper and took it on cost. The other two points have no
such excuse: 1 event in 510 is the same as 0, and 512 is 1.6-1.8x faster.

### `fd` is a promise about signals, not about trigger lists

Marginal NOISE triggers are dismissed at 2.4e-2 (captured) to 3.7e-1
(synthetic) while injections are dismissed at 0 of 2400. Not a defect: a
signal's in-band fraction is fixed by the template, a noise fluctuation's
is an independent draw. At f=1.0 nothing is dismissed at all, which is the
mechanism check. It matters anyway -- a background estimated from the
trigger distribution is not filtering signals.

### A bank that does not match its reference spends headroom

`src/hmf.c` refresh_template(): `f = p->ref_on ? p->ref_f : p->fpow[t]`.
The per-template fraction is computed and used only when no reference is
set. Loss is monotone in the template's own f: 0 above 0.936, 48.3% at
0.739. The captured pycbc bank sits FURTHER from its reference and loses
nothing, because it runs at band 1024/ratio 5.33 where the threshold audits
2.5% BELOW safe rather than 4.1% above.

### Everything left is about 1.2x

    corner turn        1.16x   structural to the four-step; the pair-batched
                               path avoids it and its buffers are 2 MiB at
                               n=16384 against a 1 MiB L2
    plain int16        1.15x   precision is FREE (0.01% against 4.1% of
                               headroom, 400x); throughput is the question
    int8 reject pass   1.19x at band 512, 1.31x at 1024, 0.99x at 256

Phase 3's "unsafe flips stay at zero by construction" is a fit to 520 pairs
and every wider sample breaks it, including the captured data (worst
0.96387 against a 1.0166 bias). A safe bias rejects less, so its 6.2% pass
rate is really 17.9-52.7%.

### Tools left behind

    tools/audit_threshold.py --coverage   table grids vs the operating range
    tools/audit_threshold.py --repeat N   the noise floor (sd 1.0-1.3%)
    tools/regen/threshold_lowratio.py     per-band rows, resumable
    AP_NOXPOSE=1 build                    ablate the corner turn
    tests/_gatelib.py                     one gate measurement, per template

### Traps hit, in case they recur

  * An ablation gated on a plan field measures its own branch. The ablated
    build came out SLOWER than the real one. Make it compile-time.
  * A cost measurement on data with a signal in every block reads 90-100%
    escalation and says nothing. Use pure noise.
  * Never compare threshold rows across band; it cost a whole wrong
    diagnosis (a070137, retracted in 6a9878e).
  * Quote no spread without the noise floor.
  * cwd-relative `sys.path.insert` -- hit three times.

## Also outstanding

  * **SWAR** -- the CPU equivalent of fp16 for the coarse stage. Queued
    deliberately behind the structural work.
  * **stageA_prod_gm is still 46%** of the coarse stage (was 58%). What
    remains inside it is two 16x16 transposes per block and a rolled
    t-loop. The coarse stage sits ~2.2x off single-core FMA peak, down from
    ~2.6x, and the rest is spread rather than concentrated.

## Negatives -- measured, do not retry

  * GMAJOR=0: 0.665 and 0.744 of the default at bands 512 and 2048.
  * GBLK=4/8, BBLK=2: within noise at coarse sizes.
  * MF_NOSTORE: no effect; the coarse plan has no series buffer.
  * Hoisting plan fields out of stageA_tail to defeat aliasing: BYTE-
    IDENTICAL output. Strict aliasing already lets GCC prove a float store
    cannot touch an int struct member.
  * Dropping binmax_one's unused arr/aii/axx accumulators: they sit inside
    `__builtin_expect(..., 0)` and almost never execute.

## Method notes that cost real time to learn

  * **This box drifts ~18% between runs minutes apart.** Sequential A/B
    measures thermal state as if it were code. Interleave old,new,old,new
    and report the paired ratio. An all-old-then-all-new sweep first put
    the 2^9 split at 11.8% when the honest figure is 5.4%.
  * **Check the symbol is on the hot path before disassembling it.** The
    first CPU instruction mix I took was of `fft64_prod`, which has ZERO
    call sites. Sample with gdb (`bt 1` in a loop) instead of guessing.
  * **Static disassembly of a function with runtime branches measures both
    paths.** stageA_prod_gm reads 1245 instructions before and after the
    ilay change because both store paths are compiled in.
