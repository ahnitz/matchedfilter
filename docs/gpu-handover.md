# Historical GPU implementation findings

This is an earlier investigation, retained for its kernel layout measurements.
Bug status, proposed fixes, and test counts below describe that snapshot, not
the current release. See [CPU/GPU parity](cpu-gpu-parity.md) for current behavior.

## 1. BLOCKING BUG: tile baked into the kernel vs the host's dispatch

**Symptom.** The hierarchical GPU filter silently dismisses signal the flat
filter finds. At n=4096, nd=2:

    nt=1   fails at bands 128, 256, 512, 1024   (all)
    nt=2   fails at band 512
    nt=3   fails at bands 128, 256, 512, 1024   (all)

It is not an exception and not a wrong peak -- peaks that ARE reported are
correct. Pairs simply never get visited, so it reads as a working gate.

**Root cause, confirmed.** `tools/build_spirv.py` line ~277:

    "#define TILE_T %d\n" % (..., COARSE_TILE_T.get(n, 1) if coarse16 else 1)

with `COARSE_TILE_T = {128: 2, 256: 2, 512: 4, 1024: 2}`. So the BASE
`tierb_<band>_c16*.spv` kernels carry the band's tile -- **there is no
TILE_T=1 kernel for those bands at all**. When the host cannot use the tile
(it needs `ntemplates % tile == 0`) it drops the DISPATCH to one tile but
still selects a kernel compiled with tile 2 or 4. That kernel walks
`TILE_T` consecutive templates from `p0 = gid.x * TILE_T` and runs off the
end of the bank.

**The fix, attempted and not completed.** Make the tile part of kernel
IDENTITY:

  1. `compile_one(..., tile=1)` -- add the parameter back (it has been lost
     twice now when the file was restored from a backup) and use `tile` in
     the define instead of `COARSE_TILE_T.get(n)`.
  2. Base `_c16`, `_c16p2`, `_c16p4` build at `tile=1`.
  3. Tiled variants build under their own suffix, spelled EXACTLY as the
     host spells it -- "p1" is omitted, so ppg=1 is `_c16t<T>`, not
     `_c16p1t<T>`.
  4. Host (`_vkcompute.py`): guard `_ppg` FIRST, then choose `_tile`
     against the FINAL ppg. Require `nt % _tile == 0` as well as
     `(nd*nt) % (_ppg*_tile) == 0` -- the tile walks TEMPLATES, so the pair
     count dividing is not sufficient (nt=2 with tile=4: 4 % 4 == 0, yet
     the tile still overruns).
  5. Filename must include `t%d` when `_tile > 1`, and the dispatch must be
     `pairs // (_ppg * _tile)` with the SAME `_tile`.

This reduced failures (nt=1 went from four bands to two) but did not close
them. **Unresolved case to start from: nd=2, nt=1, n=2048, band=1024.**
By inspection ppg=1 and tile falls back to 1, so the dispatch should be
exactly right -- meaning either the selection is not doing what it reads
like, or something downstream of it is wrong. Trace that ONE combination
(print the chosen filename, `_ppg`, `_tile`, group count) rather than
sweeping.

## 2. GPU size coverage vs the CPU

GPU lacks, relative to the CPU: **8192/256, 16384/256, 16384/512**. These
are threshold-table refusals, not kernel gaps -- `choose_threshold` now
correctly returns None below the measured hull.

Fix: extend the table at those sizes.

    python tools/regen/threshold_calibrate.py 8192  --only-new
    python tools/regen/threshold_calibrate.py 16384 --only-new

`--only-new` computes just the gap (it skips cells already present) and
took 100s for 232 cells at n=4096. Then merge into
`python/matchedfilter/threshold.txt` -- the merge is a plain dict update
keyed on (n, snr, f, ratio, fd); nothing in the table depends on its
neighbours, because every cell is an independent bisection.

The CPU side (NOT this thread's work): the CPU has **no hierarchical plan
for bands 64 or 128 at any size**. That gap is why cross-device tests skip
band 128, which is how a wave-reduction bug survived earlier today.

## 3. Cost graph -- HOLD until 1 and 2 land

It selects band 256 when 512 is 2.0x faster on the teaser (0.306 vs 0.156
ms). It cannot be rebuilt honestly over a kernel matrix that is partly
broken and thresholds that are partly refused.

`tools/regen/cost_gpu.py` needs one edit first: it still calls
`set_coarse_margin`, removed when margin was eliminated. With one
calibrated threshold per band there is no margin axis, so `MARGINS`
collapses to `[1.00]` (keep the column so the reader is unchanged) -- four
times fewer cells.

## Where the performance stands

Coarse stage, best-of-7, 512x512 pairs, n=4096, measured as a same-machine
A/B against `136a5e6` (pre-fp16) built in an isolated worktree:

    band    baseline   current   speedup
     128     1.790      0.666     2.69x
     256     1.109      0.848     1.31x
     512     2.264      1.557     1.45x
    1024     4.273      2.871     1.49x

Teaser (16x1024 pairs): GPU hier 0.33 -> 0.27 ms. It dilutes because the
coarse stage is only ~29% of that run -- refine is 56%, fixed overhead 15%.

What paid, in order: one-bin specialisation, SoA switchover, `bit_cast`
staging, twiddle recurrence. **All four DELETE work.** What never paid:
fp16 loads, permuted banks, wide `uint4` loads, deeper tiles, manual
hoisting, dual-bank staging -- all rearrangements.

ISA after the SoA work (band 512, `RADV_DEBUG=asm`): all scalar fp16
ARITHMETIC eliminated (575 ops -> 0); the 294 remaining "scalar fp16" are
`v_mov_b16` (98) and `v_cvt_f32_f16` (196), i.e. data movement and format
conversion, not computation. Largest remaining block is stalls,
`s_delay_alu` 482 + `s_waitcnt` 381 ~ 12%, which neither more waves nor
fewer instructions relieved (both measured).

## Traps that cost time today -- read before starting

  * **Check what was BUILT, not what the script says it builds.** Three
    separate incidents: `compile_one` silently lost its `tile` parameter
    (the resulting NameError did not match a grep for `error[E`); stale
    `_c16t8` artifacts from an experiment sat in `spirv/` and misled two
    rounds; and band 256 ran the old fp32 kernel for the whole session
    because `_COARSE_TILE` selected past the conversion.
  * **Read the compiled code before the fifth guess.** Five source-level
    models were falsified by measurement; both compiled-code reads
    (`RADV_DEBUG=shaderstats`, `RADV_DEBUG=asm` with
    `MESA_SHADER_CACHE_DISABLE=1`) produced root causes immediately.
  * **Timing and correctness in the same breath.** A wave reduction that
    mixed pairs measured 2.27x FASTER while dismissing three quarters of
    the signal. An over-gating threshold measured 0.115 ms against 0.271.
    Both look like wins on a stopwatch.
  * **Run-to-run variance is ~15% at band 128 and ~7% at 512.** Use
    best-of-N, not means; means argued the opposite conclusion twice.
  * **`git add -A` is unsafe here** -- a separate session works the CPU
    path in the same tree. Commit explicit paths.

The full rule set is in `docs/optimization-method.md` (13 rules, each
anchored to something that actually happened).

## 4. Size parity with the CPU

The CPU takes every power of two from 64 to 1048576. The GPU now takes 64
to 65536 -- eleven lengths, all of them checked against the CPU on index
*and* value, not merely run.

**Done.**

* **64, 128, 256, 512.** These kernels already shipped, built as coarse
  bands; the decomposition generalises down without change, so exposing
  them as transform lengths cost nothing. 192 configurations across shapes,
  windows and binsizes agree with the CPU exactly.
* **32768 and 65536.** R -- points per thread, which is also the
  decomposition radix -- became a build parameter. 16 up to 16384, then 32
  and 64, because a workgroup is capped at 1024 threads and n = WG * R.
  `dft32` and `dft64` are built from `dft16` under a decimation-in-frequency
  split, and both restore natural order before returning: `want[]` indexes
  registers by frequency, so a permuted radix would mis-route the level.
  72 configurations agree with the CPU; injections land on the exact lag.

**Remaining: 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576.** These need the four-step
split across dispatches. The decomposition is already written and checked
in `tools/gpu_tierc_model.py`:

    n = N1 * N2,  j = n1 + N1*n2,  k = k1*N2 + k2
    stage 1   for each n1: an N2-point transform over n2 of x[n1 + N1*n2],
              multiplied by W_n^(n1*k2) on the way out
    stage 3   for each k2: an N1-point transform over n1
    output    X[k1*N2 + k2]

Both factors land at 1024 or below -- a length Tier B already carries -- so
the sub-transforms are the existing kernel geometry and only the addressing
is new. Scratch is stored transposed, `A[k2*N1 + n1]`, which puts the
strided access on the write side where it does not feed a transform.

Three things that are genuinely new, and are the actual work:

1. **The peak reduction must become global.** Tier B reduces within one
   workgroup because one workgroup holds the whole transform. Stage 3
   spreads a pair's output across N2 workgroups, so the per-bin maximum
   needs an atomic table in device memory plus a second pass to write the
   index and value matching it. The float-bits-as-uint monotone trick the
   LDS path already uses carries over unchanged.
2. **Scratch is n complex per pair in flight** -- 8 MB a pair at 1048576,
   so pairs must be chunked rather than dispatched at once.
3. **Both stages are digit-reversed within themselves**, so `slotToIndex`
   applies twice: on k2 leaving stage 1, on k1 leaving stage 3. This is
   the silent-failure surface, and it is what the model pins.

Host work lands in `_vkcompute.py` and `_mtlcompute.py`, which is worth
knowing before starting: at the time of writing another session held
uncommitted changes in both.

### Method note

Both Tier B extensions were written model-first: a register-level Python
mirror of the kernel (`tools/gpu_regmodel.py`) that runs the real `want[]`
scatter, the real exchange addressing and the real `slotToIndex`, checked
against a float64 reference. It reproduces all eleven shipped lengths --
including the `dft4` quirk where the innermost radix spends two radix-2
digits rather than one radix-4 digit -- and that is the only reason
widening R was a parameter change rather than a rewrite.

Do the same for Tier C. This kernel's failure mode is a peak reported at
the wrong sample: magnitudes stay plausible, benchmarks stay fast, and only
an index comparison notices.
