# Coverage follow-up: state transitions and transfer costs

September 26, 2026. Builds on `gpu-cache-correctness.md`. Existing CPU
tuning work in the shared tree was preserved.

## Performance regression checks

Normal CI checks correctness and structural costs, including upload reuse,
cache bounds, and one warm Vulkan submission for distinct flat windows. Timing
benchmarks on shared runners remain advisory. GPU-specific checks run when
that backend is available.

Run the opt-in timing suite on an otherwise idle machine:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_performance.py --run-performance -q
```

It covers CPU and available GPU devices:

- Flat and hierarchical cached `run()` at 2,048, 4,096, and 8,192 points with
  16 data rows × 128 templates, plus 128 × 512 at 4,096 points. The peak
  threshold is 5.5; hierarchical runs use explicit band 256 and coarse
  threshold 4.0.
- Automatic peak `run_series()` at those three lengths, with 43 blocks and
  128 templates. It may cost at most 1.5 times the explicit-block reference.
- Continuous full output at 32,768 points, six templates and a 1,048,576-sample
  series. It may cost at most 1.5 times explicit blocks plus assembly.
- Vulkan irregular windows at 4,096 points, 128 blocks and 32 templates.
  Grouped submission must take at most half the separate-submission time.

Warm calls exclude setup, check results before timing, and alternate compared
paths. The relative limits allow noise while catching substantial overhead.
They cannot catch a slowdown shared by both paths. For that, record a baseline
on the known-good revision and compare the candidate in the same environment:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_performance.py --run-performance \
  --performance-record=.local/performance-baseline.json -q
python -m pytest tests/test_performance.py --run-performance \
  --performance-baseline=.local/performance-baseline.json -q
```

The comparison fails if any measured workload is over 25% slower. Host, device,
ISA, Python, and NumPy identities must match; missing workload baselines fail
instead of being silently ignored. Recording writes only after a successful
run, and refuses to overwrite the baseline used for comparison. Keep baselines in ignored local storage or CI artifacts, and refresh them
only after reviewing a deliberate change. A baseline should come from the
known-good revision, not be recreated automatically for each candidate.
Unavailable GPU cases skip explicitly. These tests are opt-in because shared
CI load and GPU clocks can overwhelm small improvements; a dedicated idle
runner can use the saved-baseline command as a blocking check.

## Gaps covered

`tests/test_vk_upload_cache.py` now exercises the actual Vulkan and Metal
host dispatch methods with allocation/submission doubles. It checks input
contents and transfer counts, so it runs without GPU hardware. Numerical
Vulkan cases also execute on the Radeon 8060S.

- Revisiting cached dispatches after data or template changes, in both flat
  and hierarchical modes. Metal had the same stale-resident-input bug as
  Vulkan. Both now share residency bookkeeping.
- More than 2048 output bins, including a shorter final split. Vulkan was
  invalidating the inputs uploaded by earlier pieces of the same call;
  subsequent unchanged calls transferred them again unnecessarily.
- Updating data must leave full and coarse template buffers resident.
- Half packing preserves the shader's real-low/imaginary-high bit format
  for contiguous, strided, reversed and transposed inputs, including signed
  zero, half subnormals, overflow, infinities and NaNs.

`tests/test_series_lifecycle.py` covers both filter classes and both devices:

- Repeated series calls with forced reuse of the temporary spectrum's
  address. Hierarchical GPU filtering returned stale complex values because
  the dirty flag was not set for the new series. The test checks a known
  complex scaling, not only unchanged peak indices.
- Empty series and fully zero-padded blocks. The GPU attempted to gather
  from an empty array; it now supplies zero spectra, matching the CPU.
- Empty block lists, malformed array dimensions, negative/overflowing
  starts, invalid template ranges, and nonpositive binsizes. A 2-D series
  originally reached an oversized GPU buffer write and crashed Python.
  Validation is shared between the two classes and runs before native
  dispatch. Tests guard that boundary so a future regression reports a
  failure rather than killing the entire suite.
- Contiguous and interleaved window groups retain block order and agree
  with independent single-block calls, including complex values.
- Changing a hierarchical GPU reference recalibrates both the metadata and
  the executed gate. A deterministic signal crosses the gate under one
  reference and is rejected under the other. Previously the old band
  fraction and scaled templates survived the reference update.
- A new series does not re-upload an unchanged template bank. Flat GPU
  filtering previously forced this upload on every series call.

## Performance checks

Transfer counts are deterministic regression tests; wall-clock thresholds
are deliberately not embedded in the suite. Residency bookkeeping uses
array metadata, never spectrum hashes or content comparisons.

Interleaved before/after measurements used the same process and the same
inputs, nine rounds with alternating execution order, warm plans, and
numerical checks outside the timed loop. The baseline snapshots are from
the start of this follow-up (including the earlier Vulkan cache fix and the
existing CPU tuning edits). The diagnostic is `/tmp/mf_coverage_benchmark.py`;
its source snapshots are `/tmp/mf-api-before-coverage.py` and
`/tmp/mf-vulkan-before-coverage.py`.

The initial hierarchical-series comparison was about 6% slower. Profiling
showed the old repeated-series path performing **zero data uploads** because
of the stale-buffer bug. Correctness requires those uploads. To offset the
cost, contiguous window groups now use a slice instead of copying their
spectra; forward FFT scaling happens in place; already-complex64 FFT results
are not copied again; and little-endian half packing converts interleaved
components in one pass instead of constructing shifted integer temporaries.
The general-endian packing fallback is retained.

Final measured medians (milliseconds):

| Workload | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| CPU flat `run` | 2.599 | 2.638 |
| CPU flat `run_series` | 10.803 | 10.838 |
| CPU hierarchical `run` | 0.700 | 0.706 |
| CPU hierarchical `run_series` | 3.350 | 3.386 |
| GPU flat `run` | 0.217 | 0.220 |
| GPU flat `run_series` | 5.821 | 4.881 |
| GPU hierarchical `run` | 0.090 | 0.090 |
| GPU hierarchical `run_series` | 4.102 | 3.478 |
| GPU split-bin `run` | 0.444 | 0.445 |

Main workloads use n=4096, 16 data spectra × 64 templates for `run`, and
64 blocks × 64 templates for `run_series`. Hierarchical band=512 and a
fixed coarse threshold isolate execution from selection. Split-bin filtering
uses four data spectra, sixteen templates and binsize=1. These are local
measurements, not claims for every batch shape or device. The small CPU
differences varied in sign across repeated runs; no CPU kernel was changed.

## Validation limits

The final full suite passed **513 tests, with 5 skipped**, in 43.00 seconds.
That is 77 additional collected cases compared with the previous turn's
438 passed / 3 skipped. The two additional skips are CPU instances of a
GPU-only transfer contract. The focused host-only run, without device access,
passed 48 tests and skipped 38 GPU cases.

After the final optimizations, all twelve saved PyCBC captures were replayed
again through flat CPU and GPU `run_series`: all **842 detected peaks** agreed
in location and complex value at rtol=atol=1e-5.

Real GPU execution was tested on the Radeon 8060S with the system C++ runtime
preloaded so Mesa could load. Metal host logic was tested on Linux using
submission doubles; execution of Metal kernels and Apple performance still
require macOS CI. The full original PyCBC search and false-dismissal budget
study remain separate work; this follow-up does not claim to close them.

## Follow-up parity review

The subsequent CPU/GPU audit adds initialization/subrange validation,
shape-preserving output reuse, threshold reset/reference/first-stage state
transitions, raw dtype checks, and refinement counters that count work rather
than detections. See [the parity audit](cpu-gpu-parity.md) for remaining feature
and operational differences. Final shared-checkout validation: 595 passed,
5 skipped on CPU plus Radeon 8060S.

## CI launch-directory and dependency regression

CI runs the installed package's tests from a scratch directory. The new tuner
regression tests exposed `tools/hmf_tune.py` importing `tests` and `tools`
relative to the current directory; from `/tmp`, four tests failed to import
`hmf_design`. That import also eagerly required SciPy, absent from the declared
NumPy/pytest runtime test environment. Resolve helper paths from `__file__` and
load the SciPy-backed legacy design helper only when a design sweep uses it.
CLI regressions now launch outside the repository, and an import test blocks
SciPy and the legacy design module. Full scratch-directory validation on the
local CPU/Radeon 8060S: 596 passed, 5 skipped in 46.72 seconds.

## Benchmark CLI configuration reporting

The hierarchical configuration is now `(band, taps)`. The benchmark CLI still
formatted three fields and indexed `cfg[2]`, crashing both console reporting
and JSON export after the flat timings completed. The CLI regression stubs only
the expensive timing operations and exercises successful two-field reporting,
JSON output, and an uncovered calibration row in the same run.

## Audit cleanup coverage

See [audit-cleanup.md](audit-cleanup.md) for the strict file/explicit calibration
contract, memory limits, cost-selection tooling, and measured performance.
New tests cover native output overruns and malformed layouts, optional magnitude
storage and scratch resizing, CPU/GPU refusal without calibration, explicit
settings without table access, rescaling already-ingested templates after a
reference change, dispatch eviction, and bounded series batches. Execution-only
matrix/arity tests explicitly open the gate; statistical tests continue to use
measured calibration. The benchmark's superset check now explicitly opens the
gate instead of relying on below-grid SNR clamping.

The exact cleanup snapshot, isolated from concurrent GPU-extension work and
launched from `/tmp`, passed **660 tests, 5 skipped** on CPU/Radeon 8060S.
The shared checkout also passed 676 tests, 5 skipped before the final below-grid
budget and float32-range guards; those guards passed 134 focused tests, and their
21 calibration-contract tests passed with warnings treated as errors. The cost
export regression additionally verifies that newly measured bands without
existing cost coverage are not exported into selection.

## Benchmark presentation

README banners use Markdown, the site resolves image assets and horizontal
rules, and the overview renders the teaser once with responsive sizing. Timing
references are FFTW/MKL only; NumPy remains the correctness oracle. Regression
tests cover missing optional engines, representative CPU target selection,
old-artifact deduplication, reference columns, and generated banner markup.
A real CPU/GPU benchmark and a 15-page site build validate the end-to-end path.

## Complete transform-size benchmark coverage

The public CLI and benchmark CI now default to every power of two from 64
to 1048576. Regression tests verify the complete emitted size list and input
memory budgets at the largest lengths. The CPU/GPU sweep uses 128 × 512
where memory permits, retains unsupported/calibration-gap rows, and validates
near-tied cross-device maxima against an independent transform. The existing flat and hierarchical chart pages show all measured lengths;
the hierarchical chart can use another runner when its preferred runner
lacks a result for a length. No separate all-sizes page is published.

The old short report stopped at 16384 to isolate a regression before the
larger GPU kernels were committed; it was not a support limit. Separate stale
README/usage paragraphs also retained the earlier range after size support
expanded. The overview, API introduction and usage table now agree with the
implemented CPU 64–1048576 and GPU 64–65536 ranges.
