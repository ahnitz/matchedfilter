     Checked on the other ISAs, since AP_W is 16/8/4 across AVX3/AVX2/SSE4

     The rule that fits every point is about where the *input* lives, not where the
     group buffers live.  While the input is cache-resident a wider stream buys
     nothing and the extra buffers only cost L2, so G=1.  Once it no longer fits
     L2, the stream shape is worth a fifth of the runtime and G should be as large
     as the split allows.  In between - input in L2 but not small - a moderate G
     wins and a large one loses: 2^16 measured G=4 3.1% faster than G=1 (32/32)
