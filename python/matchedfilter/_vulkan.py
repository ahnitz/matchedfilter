"""Enumerate Vulkan devices through the system loader, with ctypes.

Deliberately not slangpy.  slangpy is how the kernels are *compiled*, which
happens at build time; making it a runtime import would put a heavyweight
dependency -- and its numpy import-order clash -- in front of every user who
merely wants to ask what hardware exists.  Enumeration needs four entry points,
so it is cheaper to call them directly than to inherit a framework.

Nothing here forces ``VK_ICD_FILENAMES``.  An earlier version probed ICDs by
name and concluded from the failures that probing "poisons the loader"; that
was wrong, and setting the variable was itself causing ``vkCreateInstance`` to
fail with ``VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER``.  The loader's own discovery works.
See ``_shadowing_hint`` for what the failures actually were.
