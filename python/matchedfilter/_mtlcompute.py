"""Dispatching the Metal kernels, with ctypes over the Objective-C runtime.

No PyObjC and no compiled helper: the wheel carries kernels, and the only
thing it needs from the machine is Metal itself, which every Mac has.

The calling convention differs from Vulkan and the difference is silent if
got wrong. Slang lowers the entry point's uniform parameters to a CONSTANT
BUFFER at index 0 and shifts the storage buffers to 1..4, where SPIR-V puts
the storage buffers at 0..3 and the uniforms in push constants. The struct
is the same seven 32-bit fields in the same order.

UNTESTED ON LINUX by construction -- there is no Apple hardware on the
development machine, so every line here is exercised only by the macOS CI
job. It is written to fail loudly rather than plausibly.
