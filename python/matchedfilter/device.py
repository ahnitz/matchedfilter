"""Choosing where a filter runs.

The spelling is PyTorch's -- ``"cpu"``, ``"gpu"``, ``"gpu:1"`` -- because that
is what a user already has in their fingers, and a library that invents a
fourth convention for a solved problem is only making work.

Two decisions are deliberate and easy to get wrong later:

*Default is the CPU, never the GPU.*  Running somewhere else because that
somewhere happens to exist changes numerics and failure modes without the
caller asking for it.  ``device="auto"`` is available for people who want the
library to choose, but they have to say so.

*A software rasteriser is not a GPU.*  lavapipe answers ``device="gpu"``
correctly and roughly a thousand times slower than the CPU backend the caller
just bypassed, which reads as a performance bug and is really a selection bug.
It is reachable, but only by naming it.
