    This is |h(f)|^2 / S(f), NOT |h(f)|^2. The distinction is the one the
    documentation warns callers about, and this function got it wrong: it
    returned the raw f^(-7/3) signal power, which peaks in bin 1 and puts half
    its power there. Measured on that, the effective bandwidth at band 256 was
    1.9 bins against 141 for a real captured reference -- 74x too narrow.

    Effective bandwidth is what sets how sharp the correlation peak is, and a
    2-bin reference gives a maximally broad peak that the coarse lag grid
    catches for free. So the hierarchical benchmark was measuring a best case
    that no real search sees: it selected band 256 at snr 6 and reported 13x,
    where the captured reference needs band 512 there.

    The noise wall is what fixes it. S(f) rises steeply below the seismic
    knee, so the output power peaks inside the band rather than at DC. With
    the knee at 1.9% of the band this reproduces a real reference closely --
    B_eff 177 against 141 at band 256, peak bin 72 against 78, half the power
    below bin 108 against 122.

    `frac` still fixes how much power sits below `fmax_frac`, because a fixed
    exponent alone would put 99% below n/8 at n=2^20 and 60% at n=2^11, so the
    lengths would be measuring different problems. Its value and the knee are
    FITTED to the captured reference rather than chosen: least squares on
    (f, B_eff) at bands 256/512/1024 gives frac=0.895, knee=0.0150 and a 4.9%
    rms relative error --

    The previous frac=0.85 was inherited, and it mattered: it put 85% of the
    power below n/8 where a real reference has 93%, which lowered the coarse
    threshold enough to escalate 18.8% of pure-noise pairs against 1.2% on the
