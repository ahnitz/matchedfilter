/* matchedfilter - single-threaded batched filtering and full correlation.
 *
 * Correlate D data segments against T templates and get back, for each pair, the
 * loudest sample in each bin of a search window, or every correlation lag.
 *
 * Inputs are FREQUENCY DOMAIN: the unnormalised forward transform of each
 * segment, natural order, interleaved complex float32.  CPU peak filtering
 * supports powers of two from 64 to 2^20; full output supports 2^10 to 2^22.
 *
 * Correlation is circular; zero-pad before ingest for linear.  The inverse is
 * unnormalised, matching FFTW and MKL, so a perfect match returns n * energy.
 *
 * There is no plan object to manage beyond the filter itself: ap_mf_plan holds
 * everything, is built once, and is reused for every pair.

   once per segment, so it stays amortised however many pairs run.

 * Hierarchical matched filter.
 *
 * Most of a template's signal-to-noise sits in the low part of the band.  This
 * filter correlates only that part, on a coarse lag grid, and pays for the full
 * correlation only where the coarse result could plausibly become a detection.
 *
 * The guarantee is one-sided and exact: every peak this reports is bit-identical
 * to what ap_mf_run would report for the same inputs.  It never invents a peak
 * and never shifts one.  What it can do is MISS a peak, at a rate bounded by the
 * false-dismissal target given at construction.  If that trade is not acceptable,
 * use ap_mf_run.
 *
 * snr is the |rho| of the weakest signal that must be kept (5 is typical); fd is
 * the tolerated false-dismissal probability for such a signal (1e-2 .. 1e-4).
 * The caller supplies band and a nonnegative coarse threshold. The native
 * engine does not read files or derive calibration; Python resolves measured
 * files before execution. snr/fd/taps are retained for ABI compatibility.
