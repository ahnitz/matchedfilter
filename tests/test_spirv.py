"""The shipped SPIR-V, and whether it still matches the source it came from.

A stale kernel blob is a dangerous failure because it is silent: the module
loads, dispatches, and returns plausible numbers computed by the wrong code.
This project has already paid for that once -- a stale `N = 2048` left in a
kernel made a baseline 2.8x too slow, which would have flattered a speedup by
the same factor, and it was caught only because an unrelated figure was
printed beside it.

So the blobs are checked two ways: their host-side contract is pinned here,
and when slangc is present they are recompiled and compared byte for byte.
