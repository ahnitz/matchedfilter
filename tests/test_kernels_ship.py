"""Every kernel the library can ask for is present in the install.

A missing kernel is not a build error. build_spirv.py writes what it is
told to write, the package-data globs copy whatever matches, and nothing
compares the two -- so a kernel that stopped being generated, or a new
variant that no glob matched, ships as a wheel that works on the developer's
machine and fails on a device that selects the missing one.

That is not hypothetical. The flat kernel had a 32 KB variant for the two
sizes whose staging wants 64 KB and the refine kernel did not, so a device
offering 32 KB ran the flat path and could not create a hierarchical
pipeline at all. Every GPU used in development has 64 KB, so nothing here
could have noticed.

These check the SHIPPED tree via matchedfilter.__file__, so they hold for
an installed wheel and not only for a source checkout.
