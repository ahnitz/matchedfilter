"""Every public entry point on a GPU filter must actually use the GPU.

This file exists because of a specific class of bug that has now happened
twice, and that no correctness test can see:

  * HierarchicalFilter overrides __init__ and so never called _start_gpu.
    device= was accepted, .device reported "gpu:0", and every run went to
    the CPU and returned correct answers.
  * run_series had no GPU branch, so it built a CPU plan on demand and ran
    there -- again returning correct answers.

Both look like a working port. The only visible symptom is performance, and
performance is exactly what a correctness suite does not check. So these
tests assert on the MECHANISM: no CPU plan may come into existence on a GPU
filter, and a method that cannot run on the device must raise rather than
quietly relocate.
