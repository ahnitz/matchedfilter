"""A REAL reference profile, and what it shows the synthetic ones do not.

Every accuracy and threshold number in this library was calibrated against
`_gatelib.make_ref`, a synthetic profile built to hit a target (f, B_eff).
The key assumption is that those two numbers determine how the coarse gate
behaves. They do not.

`tests/data/reference_profile_pycbc.npy` is the whitened signal power
profile |H(f)|^2 / S(f) from a live pycbc inspiral search, supplied in the
fdr-overshoot handoff: n=4096, 0.5 Hz per bin, zeroed outside [20 Hz,
Nyquist], sums to 1, peak at bin 78. It is here because at band 1024 it
sits at the SAME (f, B_eff) as a synthetic reference and is dismissed
11.7x more often -- measured, at an identical gate.

The reason is scalloping. The coarse statistic is about

    snr * sqrt(f) * g

where g is the worst-case loss from the coarse lag grid landing between
samples. B_eff is a second-moment PROXY for g, and a peaked profile with a
long tail breaks the proxy: at band 1024 the real profile has g=0.896
against the synthetic's 0.931, which puts its coarse statistic at 4.45
against a gate of 4.41 -- marginal -- where the synthetic sits at 4.63 with
room to spare.

Across ten profile shapes the correlation with log dismissal is -0.49 for
the current key, -0.93 for g, and -0.96 for snr*sqrt(f)*g.
