"""The hierarchical mode across binsize, window and threshold, on every device.

The same blind spot the flat filter had, and worse. The hierarchical tests
lived in three files, all CPU-only, and their binsize coverage was 20 uses of
binsize=n, eight of 1024 and one of 512 -- so one bin over everything, and no
window matrix at all. The device-parametrised tests that did exist all built
MatchedFilter, so the device axis stopped at half the API.

Everything is asserted against the ONE-SIDED GUARANTEE, which is the mode's
actual contract and a stronger check than comparing to a reference:

    a reported peak is bit-identical to the flat filter's, because when the
    coarse pass escalates it runs that filter; only OMISSIONS are allowed.

That is why these compare hierarchical against flat rather than against
numpy. A test asserting closeness would pass while the refinement path
quietly diverged.

def test_every_size_and_band_is_correct_not_merely_runnable(device):
    """Sweep the whole (n, band) matrix and check the ANSWERS.

    Three bugs this session hid in combinations nothing exercised: a wave
    reduction that mixed pairs at band 128, a band that silently ran the
    old fp32 kernel, and a threshold extrapolated past the measured rows.
    All three produced plausible timings and correct-looking output on the
    combinations that were tested.

    So this asserts recovery and agreement, not absence of exceptions:
      * the flat filter finds the injected signal,
      * and where both report, they report the SAME peak -- which is what
        exercises the coarse and refine kernels and their index mapping at
        every compiled geometry.

    READ THE GATE CLAIM CAREFULLY. `set_coarse_threshold(0.0)` below forces
    the gate wide open on purpose, so that execution coverage does not
    depend on calibration coverage -- a size with no measured threshold
    still gets its kernels run. The consequence is that `dismissed == 0`
    CANNOT fail here: with the gate open nothing is dismissible, so that
    assertion is about the plumbing, not about the gate.

    Whether the gate dismisses correctly is a different question, and is
    tested separately -- see the threshold override test above, which runs
    the same filter at 0.0 and 1e9 and asserts the second dismisses
    everything. Do not read this sweep as evidence that a size's gate is
    calibrated: at 32768 and 65536 it is not, and a run that asks for a
    real gate raises rather than guessing.

    Combinations the library declines are skipped, not failed: not every
    band has a plan or a calibrated threshold at every size. But the count
    that DID run is asserted, so the sweep cannot quietly shrink to nothing
    -- which is exactly how the band-128 gap survived.

    A report found the GPU differing by 13% relative on triggers both
    engines place at the same time and template. The obvious explanation
    was accumulation ORDER -- float32 addition is not associative, so a
    reordered correlation sum could lose relative precision where large
    terms cancel, which is the regime whitened real data lives in.

    That explanation is WRONG, and this test is what refutes it. Sweeping
    template dynamic range over five orders of magnitude, from 8.6e+04 to
    2.0e+10, the relative difference never leaves float32 roundoff:

        dyn 8.63e+04   max rel 1.44e-06
        dyn 2.04e+03   max rel 1.14e-06

        dyn 2.02e+10   max rel 6.75e-07

    Conditioning does not amplify it. What IS real is the direction: the
    GPU is systematically LOWER, up to 544 of 544 points, which is a
    consistent difference in summation and not a race -- but it is bounded
    at roundoff and cannot flip a threshold.

    So this pins the bound rather than the hypothesis. If a change ever
    makes the GPU's value diverge for real, this fails with the
    conditioning it failed at, which is the first thing anyone would want
    to know.

    A correctness report placed a GPU argmax bug in exactly this corner:
    a restricted window with binsize equal to the WINDOW length rather than
    the transform length -- one bin over a sub-range of lags, which is the
    shape pycbc's flat path calls. The claim was that the peak search
    lands on a smaller peak in 12.6% of (block, template) pairs.

    A coverage audit explains why nothing here could have confirmed or
    refuted it: of the tests that compared two devices at all, NONE passed
    a restricted window and NONE passed binsize != n. Every cross-device
    comparison ran one bin over the full transform.

    It does not reproduce -- 270 configurations, zero mismatches -- but the
    gap was real and this closes it. Both axes matter and they interact:
    the window selects which lags are searched, the binsize partitions
    them, and an off-by-one in either shows up only when the other is not
    trivial.

    Asserts INDEX and VALUE, because an argmax bug lands on a real peak at
    a real lag: the value is self-consistent and only a cross-check against
