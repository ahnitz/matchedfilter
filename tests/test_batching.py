    """A caller may pass an array they do not keep.

    The plan holds the caller's pointer rather than copying: the coarse band
    is read straight out of it during the run, and the full spectrum is
    ingested lazily only if a pair fires. So `set_data(make_array())` --
    where nothing else references the array -- was a use-after-free, and one
    that only fired when the refine path actually ran, which needs a high
    trigger rate AND enough data segments. It segfaulted at 14 segments and
    passed at 12.

    This drives it deliberately: a reference concentrated enough to open the
    margin often, no name bound to the data, and enough segments and repeats to
    give the allocator a chance to reuse the freed block.

    Be honest about what it is worth: reverting the fix does NOT reliably
    fail it, because a use-after-free only crashes when the block is reused.
    It is a smoke test for the shape of the bug, not a proof. The test below,
    which simply walks batch shapes nothing had exercised, is what would have
    caught this in the first place.
