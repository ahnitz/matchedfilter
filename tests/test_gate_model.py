"""Guardrails for replacing the measured accuracy table with a model.

The plan this protects: the coarse gate's false-dismissal rate is not
tabulated but COMPUTED, from

    dismissal = E_offset [ P( |rho*kappa(d) + u| < thr | fine detected ) ]

where kappa is the coarse stage's response to a noiseless signal at
sub-sample offset d, and u is the in-band noise the coarse and fine stages
share. The cost table is unaffected and stays measured -- it describes the
machine, which is a moving target. This describes the algorithm, which is
physics.

These tests exist so a future optimisation cannot quietly invalidate that.
They are sized to have the POWER to see a difference big enough to matter,
which is the part that is easy to get wrong: a test that compares two rare
rates at 6000 trials agrees with everything.

WHERE THE TESTS LOOK, AND WHY NOT AT THE BUDGET. Resolving a 1.5x change in
a 1e-3 rate takes ~1e5 trials. The same 1.5x at a rate near 0.1 takes ~6000,
because it is counts that buy resolution, not trials. So agreement is
checked at LOOSE gates where the rate is 1e-2 to 1e-1, and the structural
invariants (monotone in gate, in snr, in band) are what carry it down to
the budget. test_the_comparison_can_actually_see_an_invalidating_change
proves the power rather than assuming it.
