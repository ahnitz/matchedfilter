"""Build hook for the matchedfilter extension.

Project metadata lives in pyproject.toml; this file exists only because the
build needs a few compiler flags and Highway's support sources, which
declarative config cannot express.

There are no per-ISA compilation groups any more.  src/kernel.cc includes
hwy/foreach_target.h, so the compiler emits one copy of the kernel per SIMD
target Highway supports on the build machine, each with its own target
attributes, and picks between them at run time.  Nothing below names a target.
