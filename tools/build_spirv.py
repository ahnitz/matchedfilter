"""Compile the GPU kernels to SPIR-V and embed them in the package.

Ahead-of-time, at build time, for two reasons.  The wheel must carry every
backend with no user choice of wheel and no extra package to install, so the
kernels cannot be compiled on the user's machine -- that would put the Slang
toolchain on their critical path.  And compiling once in CI means the shipped
blob is the artefact that was tested, rather than whatever a user's driver
happens to produce.

slangc is a BUILD dependency only.  Nothing at runtime imports slangpy or
touches Slang; the runtime reads these blobs and hands them to Vulkan.

#:
#: A software rasteriser will not catch this: llvmpipe reports 32 KB and
#: then runs a 64 KB kernel anyway, so the lavapipe CI path passes where
#: real hardware would fail to create the pipeline.
PORTABLE_CAP = 4096          # complex, = 32 KB

#: The two widest lengths inherit 16384's staging: CH = CAP/WG = 8 either

#: far less threadgroup memory per core, so a second resident workgroup buys
#: it less than the barriers cost; the Radeon has enough to keep several in
#: flight and would rather have them.
#:
