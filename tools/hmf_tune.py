    Repeating the clock on one realisation does not help: measured, the ratio
    CV was 2.5%, 1.8%, 2.8% at 3, 8 and 20 repeats -- flat, because the
    variation is not in the timer. It is in the data. A different noise draw
    escalates differently, so it genuinely costs something different, and that
    is what has to be averaged.

    Averaging draws behaves exactly as independent samples should:

        draws     1      2      4      8
        CV     3.33%  2.27%  1.56%  0.82%
